The patient continues the Indiana Modified Duran The following AROM exercises are performed without wearing an orthosis, 4-6 times a day, 15 repetitions: Active wrist tenodesis exercise Active place and hold exercise (lightly flexing as the wrist goes into extension) Active fist followed by gentle active extension with the wrist in neutral Active straight fist with flexion of the PIP joints, followed by extension with the wrist in neutral Passively making a fist, followed by passively extending the MP joints into full extension, while maintaining the IP joints in flexion: Slowly removing the hand and attempting to maintain the active hook-fist position: Active fist, followed by actively extending the MP joints while maintaining the IP joints in flexion: This is followed by lightly extending the fingers (active hook-fist exercise)_ AROM of the wrist in flexion and extension with the digits relaxed<br /><br />| NMES may be added to the therapy program to maximize the active excursion of the FDS and FDP . NMES would be used after the patient has performed the PROM exercises and tenodesis exercises. 5 Weeks Postop A custom-fabricated hand-based blocking orthosis can be designed and fabricated to limit active MP joint flexion: The orthosis can be worn during the day as part of the exercise session, to facilitate active flexion at the PIP and DIP joint level. Typically, the MPJ is positioned in 459 of flexion: The Indiana Modified Duran exercises and AROM exercises are continued: 6 Weeks Postop repairs that have achieved 2 80% of normal motion in the digit: The dorsal blocking orthosis is discontinued. The orthosis is continued an additional week for small finger The new exercises include: and digits Active fist with the wrist in extension, followed by actively extending the wrist Gentle blocking exercises to the PIP joint [except the small finger] Gentle blocking exercises to the DIP joint [except the small finger] [Note: Slightly flex the joint that is proximal to the joint where blocking is performed:] being [Note: If excellent range of motion has been achieved (i.e. motion) then blocking is not recommended, In addition, blocking is 80-859 of normal permitted to the small finger as it may risk rupture ] not perform passive extension to the DIP joint:] Passive extension to the PIP joint wilh the MP joint flexed + 450 [Note: Do not<br /><br />215<br /><br />
