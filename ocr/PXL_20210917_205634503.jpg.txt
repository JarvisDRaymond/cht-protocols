Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIR ZONE III CENTRAL SLIP REPAIR [Early Active Motion]

INDICATIONS Simple lacerations to the central slip; may include lateral bands Understanding and compliant patient POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed. An initial evaluation is performed,

An elastic stockinette is applied to the hand and forearm, along with digital level edera control consisting of 1 sterile gauze and CobanTM or fingersocks. A custom-fabricated extension orthosis is fitted positioning the PIP joint in full extension for continual wear. If the PIPJ cannot be held in 09 of extension due to edema, include the MP and DIP joints as needed to ensure full extension initially: AROM of the DIP joint is permitted.

second orthosis is fabricated positioning the PIP and DIP joints in 309 of flexion: This orthosis is used with the "short arc motion (SAM) " exercise program:

With the straps removed from the second orthosis, the orthosis is positioned to permit full active extension of the PIP and DIP joints and t309 of active flexion at the PIP joint level: Exercises are performed 4-6 times a day 15 repetitions:

10 Days Postop The sutures are removed.

Within 48 hours following suture removal (assuming the incision site is healed), scar mobilization techniques may include scar massage with lotion, along with applying a scar pad: troe corates Conate orT"3 Edema control 1 CobanTM Or fingersocks.

1 this time frame. The extension orthosis, worn between exercise sessions and at night, should include only the PIP joint by The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 459 flexion, so long as the active PIPJ extension is <59 . 2 Weeks Postop The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 609 flexion, so 3 Weeks Postop long as the active PIPJ extension is <58 . The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 908 flexion , so long as active PIPJ extension is <5' . Following 2-3 days 4 Weeks Postop of exercise in this arc of motion, assuming the extensor lag is < 109, the exercise orthosis may be blocking the MP joint in * 459 of flexion and actively extending the PIP joint; If the MP joint tends to discontinued: Gentle composite active flexion and extension may be initiated, Emphasis is placed on fabricated for exercise sessions. hyperextend with active extension, a blocking orthosis positioning the MP joint in flexion can be Applying digital level Kinesio@ Tape on the dorsum of the digittin ful extension cssists withrasscecigtoe extension and serves to mobilize the skin with ROM exercises  This simple technique has proved valuable for these authors. Isolated 6 Weeks Postop passive flexion to the PIP joint; with the MP joint extended, is initiated: The extension orthosis is removed for 3 one hour sessions during the day for light activities, assuming the extensor lag is <109 . 152
