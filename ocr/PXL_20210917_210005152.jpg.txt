Chapter 31: NERVE REPAIRS MEDIAN NERVE REPAIR [WRIST to FOREARM LEVEL]

POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION The postoperative rehabilitation program outlined below is specific to an isolated median nerve repair, which is relatively uncommon: Isolated injuries occur most often from some type of puncture wound: The treatment approach described below may be incorporated into & program with combined flexor tendon repairs in Zone V. It is essential to protect the tendon repairs (i.e. orthosis and therapy exercises), along with the median nerve repair: [Refer to chapter 21 on flexor tendon repair] 5 _ 7 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed. An initial evaluation is performed. light compressive dressing is applied for edema control: A custom-fabricated DBO is fitted to the wrist, with the wrist in neutral (0" of extension): [Note: Positioning the wrist in mild flexion may be necessary when the nerve repair is under notable tension: In most cases, this is avoided and is addressed with the surgical approach:] Active and PROM exercises are initiated to the digits and thumb 3-4 times a day, 25 repetitions: Emphasis should be placed on blocking exercises (thumb & digits) to ensure the long flexors do not become adherent to the area of the surgical repair. In addition, the hook-fist is desirable as it creates differential excursion between the FDS and FDP .

10 7 14 Days Postop The sutures/staples are removed:

Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated. In addition, a scar pad may be fitted to wear at night:

Manual desensitization may be initiated 2-3 times a day, for * 5 minutes. [Patient Handout]

Short arc, light active wrist flexion followed by active extension within the restraints of the DBO may be initiated. [Note: The palmar strap is removed to perform the wrist exercises.  This allows the scar tissue to form parallel to the nerve, in an organized fashion, as opposed to disorganized scar that may prevent the nerve repair from freely gliding:] The exercises may be performed * 4 times a day, 25 slow repetitions:

3 Weeks Postop The DBO may be adjusted to increase wrist extension 159_

Weeks Postop The DBO may be adjusted to increase wrist extension another 159.

5 Weeks Postop The orthosis is adjusted an additional 159.

Continue with AROM within the restraints of the orthosis. The goal is to gradually and gently elongate adhesions surrounding the nerve.

6 Weeks Postop The orthosis is discontinued, with the exception of lifting weighted objects (2 5 pounds) and performing tasks with high repetition and/or a tight, sustained grip. Exercises should gradually transition to full arc motion over the course of a week:

7 Weeks Postop Self-passive wrist andlor combined wrist and digital extension may be initiated; holding the end-range for + 15 seconds. To repeat 25 repetitions is recommended: [Note: Moist heat in combination with the gentle passive stretch is typically effective:]

Progressive strengthening may be initiated to the hand with putty and/or a hand exerciser with rubber band traction.
