<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS EARLY MOTION 3 ZONES VII & Vill</h1>
INDICATIONS The early motion program for extensor tendon repairs is indicated for complex extensor tendon injuries in which the periosteum is violated or the soft tissue Is extensively involved with Zone V to Zone VIII lacerations and repairs. Another indicalion for the early molion program is rigid fixatiom of any metacarpal fracture in the area of Zone V L VIII; with a concomitant extensor tendon injury: This therapy program is not necessary for simple lacerations. Typically straight forward extensor tendon repairs have excellent results with a 4 week immobilization program prior to commencing active range of motion exercises:<br /><br />RATIONALE Ae EARLY MOTION PROGRAM The early motion program permits & minimum of 3 Smm of extensor tendon excursion, which is believed to be sufficient to prevent dense peritendinous adhesions from blocking tendon gliding In all likelhood; without early motion the extensor tendons would become severely adherent to bone and subcutaneous tissue The early motion favorably influences the orientation of the collagen fibers along the tendons: By permitting 458 of MP joint flexion; this reduces the risk of MP joint extension contractures by allowing tension on the collateral ligaments; AROM exercises decrease edema and maintain soft tissue elasticity <br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 ~ 5 Days Postop The bulky dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed:<br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied to the hand and forearm, along with fingersocks or 1 CobanTm_ A custom-fabricated forearm based dynamic orthosis is fabricated with the wrist positioned in 159 of extension: Af the digital level, wide 2" Velcro@ slings with rubber band traction (supporting the PIP and DIP joints) are Utilized to maintain the MP and IP joints in extension: The orthosis is worn during exercise sessions. Note: The slings should be of sufficient width to block both PIP and DIP joint flexion: If necessary, individual custom-fabricated extension orthoses may be fitted in place of the slings. The second orthosis is & custom-fabricated volar flexion blocking orthosis is fitted in & bivalve fashion to the dynamic orthosis. This orthosis positions the wrist in 159 of extension, the MP joints in 459 of flexion and the IP joints in extension: AROM exercises are initiated at the MP joint level with the rubber band traction. The patient attempts to simply flex the MP joints of the fingers to the volar base of the static forearm based resting pan orthosis This allows the patient to flex approximately 459 at the MP joint: Through the dynamic rubber band traction, the MP joints are then brought back into neutral extension. The patient performs these exercises 15 repetitions each two hours. Between exercise sessions and at night, the patient is fitted with @ custom-fabricated forearm based extension orthosis with the wrist in 159 of extension and the MP joints in 09 of extension: The patient is cautioned to passively hold the wrist and digits in full extension, while changing to the forearm based static extension orthosis. Active and PROM exercises are performed to the IP joints twice a day (25 repetitions) while in the forearm based static extension orthosis. These exercises are performed once in the morning before applying the dynamic orthosis (which is worn during the day) and once later in the afternoon or evening:<br /><br />10 4 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed:<br /><br />176<br /><br />
