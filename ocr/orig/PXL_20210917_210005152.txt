<h1>Chapter 31: NERVE REPAIRS ULNAR NERVE REPAIR [WRIST to FOREARM LEVEL]</h1>
POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION The postoperative rehabilitation program is specific to an isolated Ulnar nerve repair, which is relatively uncommon:<br /><br />The treatment approach described below may be incorporated into a program with combined flexor tendon repairs in Zone V. Itis essential to protect the tendon repairs (i.e. orthosis and therapy exercises) , along with the Ulnar nerve repair: [Refer to Chapter 21 on flexor tendon repairs]<br /><br />5 - 7 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed:<br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied to the hand and forearm for edema control.<br /><br />custom-fabricated dorsal blocking orthosis for the wrist is fitted in neutral (09 extension) and the MPJs in 450 of flexion: [Note: Positioning the wrist in mild flexion may be necessary when the nerve repair is under notable tension. In most cases, this is avoided and is addressed with the surgical approach:] Active and PROM exercises are initiated to the digits and thumb 3-4 times a day 25 repetitions: Emphasis should be placed on blocking exercises (thumb & digits) to ensure the long flexors do not become adherent to the area of the surgical repair In addition, the hook-fist is desirable as it creates differential excursion between the FDS and FDP.<br /><br />10 - 14 Days Postop The sutures/staples are removed.<br /><br />Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated: In addition, a scar pad may be applied for night wear:<br /><br />NMES may be added in the presence of limited tendon excursion of the extrinsic flexors: ShorRrc lightactive wist flexion followed by active extension may be initiated within the restraints of the DBO. [Note: The palmar strap is removed to perform the wrist exercises. The exercises allow the scar 'pseleto foem parallel to the nerve in an organized fashion, as opposed to disorganized scar that may prevent the nerve repair from freely gliding:] The exercises may be performed + slow repetitions: 4 times a day, 25<br /><br />Manual desensitization exercises may be initiated 2-3 times a day, 5 minutes. 3 Weeks Postop The DBO may be adjusted to increase wrist extension 159 . 4 Weeks Postop The DBO may be adjusted to increase wrist extension another 159, 5 Weeks Postop The DBO may be adjusted an additional 159 , The goal is to gradually and Continue with AROM for the wrist, within the DBO_ gently elongate adhesions surrounding the nerve. 6 Weeks Postop The orthosis is discontinued, with the exception of tasks with high repetition and/or lifting a weighted objects (2 5 pounds) and performing tight, sustained grip. Full arc AROM is permitted for the wrist, A hand based DBO is fitted with the MPJs clawing: (ring and small) in 459 flexion to wear at all times, to prevent<br /><br />
