3 Weeks Postop The orthoses are adjusted to allow active flexion at the MP joint level between 459_ 509 .<br /><br />Active-assisted extension is permitted within the restraints of the outrigger and forearm based flexion stop.<br /><br />Ultrasound may be incorporated into the therapy program to enhance the mobility of the underlying soft tissues and influence the scar tissue and adhesions. Weeks Postop AROM exercises are initiated out of the oUtrigger and blocking orthoses 4-6 times a day, 25 repetitions. Those exercises include: Mid-range active flexion and extension in a tenodesis movement pattern Short-arc to mid-range composite active flexion followed by forceful active extension Active extension with the wrist in neutral to slight extension Isolated active extension of the index and small fingers (i.e. EIP and EDQM) ; particularly important with lacerations to the index and small AROM to the wrist Isolated EDC exercises with the IP joints flexed (IPJs may be taped to better isolate the MP Js) .<br /><br />The custom-fabricated forearm based extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night.<br /><br />NMES may be initiated to enhance tendon gliding through the dense adhesions. To use NMES 3-4 times a day at this time frame is beneficial,<br /><br />5 Weeks Postop Self-passive exercises may be added for the wrist.<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop Self-passive exercises may be added for the digits: Begin with isolated passive flexion to each joint: Within 2-3 days, begin adding composite passive flexion, so long as the extensor lag does not increase. 7 Weeks Postop PROM exercises (therapist assistance) may be initiated to the wrist and digits. An overzealous attempt to recapture passive flexion too quickly will likely result in creating an extensor lag have where the adhesions not been gradually mobilized and elongated: [Note: It is extremely difficult to recapture extension once lost:]<br /><br />Dorsal taping may be initiated 2-3 times a day for 20 minute sessions [Note: Should the taping not reflect notable gains, consider transitioning to & custom-fabricated dynamic flexion and/or wrist:]   Typically, this would be worn 3-4 times a orthosis for the digits day for 20-30 minute sessions. The forearm based static orthosis worn between exercise sessions and at night may be removed for 3 one hour sessions during the day for light activities.
