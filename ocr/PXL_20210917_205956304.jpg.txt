<h1>Chapter 31: NERVE REPAIRS MEDIAN NERVE REPAIR [WRIST to FOREARM LEVEL]</h1>3 1 9 1<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION The postoperative rehabilitation program outlined below is specific to an isolated median nerve repair, which is relatively uncommon: Isolated injuries occur most often from some type of puncture wound. The treatment approach described below may be incorporated into & program with combined flexor tendon repairs in Zone V It is essential to protect the tendon repairs (i.e. orthosis and therapy exercises), along with the median nerve repair. [Refer to chapter 21 on flexor tendon repair]<br /><br />5 - 7 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed: An initial evaluation is performed <br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied for edema control. custom-fabricated DBO is fitted to the wrist, with the wrist in neutral (0o of extension): [Note: Positioning the wrist in mild flexion may be necessary when the nerve repair is under notable tension. In most cases, this is avoided and is addressed with the surgical approach:]<br /><br />Active and PROM exercises are initiated to the digits and thumb 3-4 times a day, 25 repetitions: Emphasis should be placed on blocking exercises (thumb & digits) to ensure the long flexors do not become adherent to the area of the surgical repair. In addition, the hook-fist is desirable as it creates differential excursion between the FDS and FDP.<br /><br />10 7 14 Days Postop The sutures/staples are removed.<br /><br />Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated. In addition, a scar pad may be fitted to wear at night.<br /><br />Manual desensitization may be initiated 2-3 times a day, for t 5 minutes [Patient Handout] Shortarc, light active wrist flexion followed by active extension within the restraints of the DBO may be initiated. [Note: The palmar strap is removed to perform the wrist exercises: This allows the scar tissue to form parallel to the nerve; in an organized fashion; as opposed to disorganized scar that may prevent the nerve repair from freely gliding:] The exercises may be performed * 4 times & repetitions. day, 25 slow<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop The DBO may be adjusted to increase wrist extension 159 .<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop The DBO may be adjusted to increase wrist extension another 159 .<br /><br />5 Weeks Postop The orthosis is adjusted an additional 159 .<br /><br />COneinue with AROM within the restraints of the orthosis.
