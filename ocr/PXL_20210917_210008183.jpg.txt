<h1>Chapter 31: NERVE REPAIRS ULNAR NERVE REPAIR [WRIST to FOREARM LEVEL] [continued]</h1> 7 Weeks Postop Self-passive wrist and/or combined wist and digital extension may be initiated, holding the end-range for 115 seconds. To repeat 25 repetitions is recommended: [Note: The MP Js of the ring and small finge should not be fully extended during the combined passive extension of the wrist and digits ] Moist heat, in combination with the gentle passive stretch, is effective. Light strengthening may be initiated to the hand with putty and/or a hand exerciser with rubber band traction: 8 Weeks Postop Strengthening with hand-held weights may be initiated. To begin with 1-3 pounds and progress to 4-6 pounds over a month should be adequate to gradually rebuild endurance and initial strength for the wrist, forearm, elbow and shoulder.<br /><br />12 Weeks Postop A work conditioning program is recommended for patients returning to work where the job requires significant strength or fine motor skills, and/or to assess for alternative job duties:<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS NMES can be effective in noting the early return of motor function by stimulating the adductor pollicis, the dorsal and volar interossei, the opponens digiti minimi, the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, and the 3rd and 4th lumbricals. The earliest these authors have noted early re-innervation is between 3 & 4 months post repair.<br /><br />Recovery of intrinsic motor function is not common in adults.  Secondary tendon transfers are often necessary<br /><br />L Oreahnac The the clawing Jocving B DBO resolved, with the er tens tendon in flexion transfers orthosis are performed: is continued until nerve regeneration is observed, Patient education is critical regarding sensory impairment: occluded as they attempt to use their hand: Without adequate sensibility, the patient could re-injure Patients must be sure their vision is not their hand while performing daily activities and work tasks. Typically, an isolated nerve laceration does not occur at the wrist or forearm level. forearm flexor tendons are also involved. Refer to Chapter 21 on flexor tendon repairs in Zone V to Usually, the wrist anc review the postoperative course of rehabilitation:<br /><br />
