<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS PROXIMAL FOREARM MUSCLE REPAIRS Early Active Motion</h1>
INDICATION Isolated muscle lacerations are not common; yet there are instances where the muscle may be lacerated  Surgery is often performed, with the lacerated muscle fibers repaired to the extent possible:<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed:.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed.<br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied to the forearm and hand. A custom-fabricated forearm based orthosis is fabricated immobilizing the wrist in & neutral position: For isolated muscle lacerations of the extrinsic flexors (FPL, FDS, FDP) , often it is not necessary to immobilize the digits or the thumb.<br /><br />Gentle AROM exercises (short to mid-range) may be initiated to the wrist and hand 3-4 times a day, 25 repetitions.<br /><br />10 - 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed.<br /><br />Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated 3-4 times a day for 3-5 minutes: Frequent scar massage is encouraged as dense scarring may occur.<br /><br />The compressive dressing is replaced with an elastic stockinette.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop Mid-range AROM exercises are continued for the wrist, along with full-arc AROM of the hand. Gentle PROM may be performed to the wrist.<br /><br />The orthosis is continued between exercises and at night:<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop Full arc AROM may be performed for the wrist.<br /><br />5 Weeks Postop The wrist orthosis is not worn with ADLs.<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop The wrist orthosis is discontinued during the day (except when lifting weighted objects) and discontinued at night.<br /><br />7 - 8 Weeks Postop A gradual hand/wrist endurance building/strengthening program may be added should weakness be present. Activities requiringhigh physical demand and those demanding & tight sustained grip against a counter-resistance may resume +12 weeks post repair. CONSIDERATIONS The surgeon will determine whether immobilization is necessary, based on the repair, the location, length and depth of the laceration. Typically, any immobilization is short-term, with an efficientreturn normal, light activity and full restoration of motion within 4-6 weeks; to<br /><br />240<br /><br />
