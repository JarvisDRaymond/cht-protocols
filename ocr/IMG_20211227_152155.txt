Gradual passive extension of the wrist and digits is initiated. Initially (first 3-5 days) , focus on gradually increasing passive wrist extension and separately, digital extension with the wrist in neutral: A week later; permit composite passive extension at both levels to resolve the EFT .<br /><br />Exercises emphasizing differential tendon gliding of the FDS and FDP are encouraged, including differential tendon gliding with the hook-fist exercise. In addition, add isolated blocking exercises with the proximal joints in extension.<br /><br />A custom-fabricated wrist and MP joint blocking orthosis may be fabricated with the wrist in full extension to isolate the FDS and FDP and enhance tendon gliding or the patient may be fitted with & hand-based orthosis blocking the MPJs in * 458 flexion to maximize active IPJ flexion <br /><br />A custom-fabricated forearm based extension orthosis (static or dynamic) may be initiated if extrinsic flexor tightness is significant: Note: It is common to require some form of static, static progressive or dynamic orthosis to resolve the EFT. When the extrinsic tightness is severe (.e. cannot achieve passive wrist extension past 08 and MPJ, PIPJ and DIPJ passive extension is limited 458 or more), then the extension orthosis may need to be worn the majority of the time between exercise sessions and at night.<br /><br />Add the hook-fist exercise actively; without the assistance of the opposite hand:<br /><br />Gradual, progressive resistance may be initiated with soft putty and & low resistance hand exerciser. 7 - 8 Weeks Postop 1-2 pound hand weights may be initiated for the wrist.
