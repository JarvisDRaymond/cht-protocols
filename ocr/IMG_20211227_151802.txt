<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS EXTENSOR POLLICIS LONGUS (EPL) REPAIR [contlnued]</h1>
7 Weeks Postop [continued] Taping may be initiated to increase composite passive flexion of the thumb . The advantage of taping is that it allows wrist motion to assist with overcoming extrinsic tightness of the EPL;<br /><br />A custom-fabricated dynamic orthosis may be initiated to increase passive Ilexion of the thumb, as needed. Typically, the orthosis is worn 3-4 times a day for 20 minute sessions. When dynamic flexion is added to the therapy program it is important to monitor for an extensor lag: With limited exception; the extension orthosis may be discontinued during the day.<br /><br />8 Weeks Postop Typically, the thumb extension orthosis may be discontinued at night. This assumes the IP joint achieves 0" of extension. [It is fairly uncommon to restore full active hyperextension of the IP joint:]<br /><br />Soft putty may be initiated for both the FPL and EPL;<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS With the initial fitting of the wrist and thumb static orthosis, it is critical to ensure the IP joint of the thumb is positioned in slight hyperextension: Failure to achieve this position will result in an extensor lag:<br /><br />As PROM exercises are initiated, monitor for an extensor lag:<br /><br />Typically, the thumb will regain IP joint extension to neutral. It is less likely IP joint "hyper extension' will be recovered to the same degree of the opposite extremity.<br /><br />With isolated lacerations and repairs of the APL and/or EPB, the thumb IP joint may be left free with the initial orthosis due to the insertions of the tendons being proximal to the IP joint of the thumb.<br /><br />180<br /><br />
