This includles; scar massage wilh lolion, along wilh the Use of a scar pad at night.<br /><br />The Iight compressive clressing Is replaced wilh an elastic stockinette and/or an edema glove. Persistent odema on the dorsum of Ihe hand is nol uncommon;<br /><br />The orlhosis is adjusted to include Ihe wrisl and MP joints only and to ensure the MP joints are in full exlension: If the orlhosis is nol effeclive in maintaining full MP joint extension, continue with the initial orthosis wilh the entire digitls) extended: Separately, fabricate a second forearm based orthosis with the MP joints only, to wear during the day:<br /><br />Ultrasound may be initiated early to favorably influence the early formation of adhesions/scar tissue.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop While in the extension orlhosis, the straps to the fingers may be removed to allow active extension of the digils from their resling position in the orthosis. The strap on the dorsum of the hand itself remains attached to permit digital motion only.<br /><br />Genlle, mid-range active motion may be performed to the wrist, with the digits in extension 4-6 times a day; 15-25 repetitions.<br /><br />Weeks Postop AROM exercises are initiated to the wrist and digits 6 times a day, 25 repetitions. Exercises include: Short-arc to mid-range active flexion of the digits with the wrist in extension, followed by forceful active extension [Note: Within 3-5 days, full arc active flexion is permitted: The goal is to gradually mobilize the adhesions versus disrupting them and increasing scar tissue.] Composite active flexion/extension of all digits with emphasis on a tenodesis movement pattern initially to facilitate MP joint extension and gradually mobilize restricting adhesions Isolated EDC exercises, with the IP joints remaining flexed, while flexing/extending the MP joints. IP J slings may be used to maintain IPJ flexion while exercising the MP joints. Isolated EIP and EDQM exercises to the index and small fingers Active & AAROM to the wrist, wilh the digits relaxed or positioned in extension: Active MP J flexion and extension with the IP Js extended:<br /><br />NMES may be iniliated as necessary to enhance tendon excursion. Itis particularly effective when isolating the EDC wilh the IP joints taped in flexion or by Using the IPJ slings: Scar retraction is further emphasized, There Is @ high propensity for adherence of the repairs to the underlying subculaneous Iissue, Anon-skid producl, Dycem@ may be used to stabilize the skin proximal to the area of adherence, As Ihe palienl allempts to isolate Ihe MP joints, with the tendons gliding proximally Iho scar can be mobillzed distally (In Ihe opposile direction).
