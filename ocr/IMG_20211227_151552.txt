<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIR ZONE IV Early Acllve Molion</h1>
INDICATIONS Simple lacerations to the extensor tendon; may include lateral bands Patient capable and interested in following the therapy home program<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 -5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed.<br /><br />An elastic stockinette is applied to the hand and forearm, along with digital level edema control consisting of 1 sterile gauze and CobanTM or fingersocks.<br /><br />A custom-fabricated extension orthosis is fitted positioning the PIP and DIP joint in full extension for continual wear.<br /><br />A second orthosis is fabricated positioning the PIP and DIP joints in 308 of flexion: This orthosis is used with the "short arc motion (SAM)' exercise program:<br /><br />With the straps removed from the second orthosis, the orthosis is positioned to permit light active extension of the PIP and DIP joints and 309 of active flexion at the PIP and DIP joint level. Exercises are performed 4-6 times a day 15 repetitions. [Patient Handout]<br /><br />10 Days Postop The sutures are removed:<br /><br />Within 48 hours following suture removal (assuming the incision site is healed) , scar massage with lotion is initiated 2-3 times a day for 3-5 minutes:<br /><br />Edema control consists Of 1 CobanTM or fingersocks:<br /><br />The extension orthosis, worn between exercise sessions and at night, may be modified to include only the PIP joint, if preferred:<br /><br />2 Weeks Postop The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 458 flexion, assuming the extensor lag is <59 . If not, do not increase the flexion in the orthosis.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 609 flexion, assuming the extensor lag is <59.<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 750 flexion. Again, this is assuming the extensor lag is negligible. Following 3-4 days of exercise in this arc of motion, the exercise orthosis may be adjusted to 909 . By 5 weeks postop, the exercise orthosis may be discontinued and gentle composite active flexion and full effort active extension may be initiated. An additional exercise to include is reverse blocking for active PIP joint extension; If the MP joint tends to hyperextend with active extension, @ custom-fabricated blocking orthosis (positioning the MP joint in flexion) can be fabricated for exercise sessions. [Note: A simple custom exercise orthosis (such as the Yoke design/relative motion orthosis) , would be quality designs:]<br /><br />Applying Kinesio@ Tape on the dorsum of the digit, with the digit in full extension, assists with digital extension and serves to mobilize the skin with ROM. In addition, it can aid in decreasing edema: 5 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis may be removed 3-4 times a day for one hour sessions to perform light ADLs, assuming the extensor lag is <109 .<br /><br /><br /><br />6 Weeks Postop Isolated passive flexion may be initiated to the PIP and DIP joints.<br /><br />160<br /><br />
