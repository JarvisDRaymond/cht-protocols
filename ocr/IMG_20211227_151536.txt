<h1>Chapler I7: EXTENSOR TENDON INJURIES PSEUDO-BOUIONNIERE DEFORMITY Non-Surglcal Managemenl</h1>
DESCRIPTION OF DIAGNOSIS The lerm 'pseudo boulomniore' Is Used/ lo clcsslly a group ol PIP hyporexlenslon Injuries Ihal present with a boulonniere-Iike appearance; Wilh Ihe pseuclo bouforniero dlolormily Ihere is @ PIP joint flexion contracture and Ihe DIP' joint poslures In slighl hyperexlension. The DIP joint is passively Ilexible with the PIP joinl extended; Wilh & Irue boulonniere dleformily, Ihe ORL Is Ilghl and passive DIP flexion is extremely limited or nol possible, Wilh Ihe pseudlo boulorniere dleformily, Ihe extersor mechanism has not been damaged; bul Ihe volar plate (proximal allachmenl) has been avulsed wilh subsequent scarring in the Ilexed posture.<br /><br />NON-SURGICAL MANAGEMENT THERAPY An initial evaluation is performed, It is important to measure composite active and passive motion, along with isolated DIP joint motion (with Ihe PIP joint extended)<br /><br />In the presence of a PIP joint flexion contracture, initiate d custom-fabricated dynamic or static progressive extension orthosis to the PIP joint, The orthosis wearing schedule will vary based on the degree of contracture and the passive end feel. Typically, the orthosis is worn # 5-6 times a day for 20 minute to 30 minute sessions.<br /><br />Unrestricted active and PROM exercises are initiated to the involved digit to perform following each session with the dynamic orthosis.<br /><br />1 Once full passive PIP joint extension is achieved to neutral, a serial cast is fitted to the PIP joint for continuous wear. custom-fabricated PIP joint extension orthosis is another option: Active and PROM exercises are continued to the DIP joint alone to prevent ORL tightness. 6 Weeks AROM exercises are initiated 4-6 times a flexion for 3-4 day, 25 repetitions. days Emphasis is placed mid-range active and then transition to full-range within a week: In addition, add reverse facilitate PIP joinf extension: [Note: Provide maximum effort with active extensiodc blocking to active flexion the initial days of beginning motion. along with gentle tissue structures, and avoid creating an extensor The goal is to gradually mobilize the joint and soft lag:] Cheterterasior orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night with either custom-fabricated extension orthosis to the PIP joint: a serial cast or 7 Weeks pROle eeercises may be initiated: Initially to perform isolated passive flexion joint extended is recommended. Isolated passive and to the PIP joint, with the MP active ROM is continued for the DIP joint. The extension orthosis is removed 3 one hour sessions & day for light activities. 8 Weeks A custom-fabricated dynamic flexion orthosis may be initiated to worn 14 tirnes & day for 20-30 minute sessions. mobilize the PIP joint. The orthosis is The extension orthosis is reroved for 6 one hour sessions @ day  9 Weeks The ertension orthosis is worn 3 tires a day for one hour sessions, along with night wear. 10 Weeks The extension orthosis is discontinued discontinued by 12 weeks; during the day and worn every olher night, The orthosis is<br /><br />157<br /><br />
