<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES V & VI C Delayed Motion [continued]</h1>
4 Weeks Postop [continued] Ultrasound may be initiated as & means of heat to facilitate tendon gliding and minimize scar adherence. This is one indication where Ultrasound is valuable, from @ clinical perspective.<br /><br />Moist heat before exercise sessions is beneficial for enhancing mobility and comfort with exercise.<br /><br />Kinesio@ Taping to the dorsum of the hand may assist with reducing dorsal hand edema and effect localized areas of scar adherence.<br /><br />The forearm based extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night. The orthosis may be left off for 1-2 one hour sessions for light ADLs.<br /><br />5 Weeks Postop Exercises to add: combined active flexion of the wrist and digits (to begin addressing extrinsic extensor tightness) , isolated PROM to the wrist, and emphasize the active hook-fist exercise.<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop PROM exercises may be initiated to the hand. Initially, emphasis is placed on isolated passive flexion to the MP and PIP joints with the wrist extended: Once this is easily accomplished, it becomes important to add passive flexion of the MP and PIP joints with the wrist extended. So long as an extensor lag is not a concern, the final exercise to add is composite passive wrist flexion with digital flexion:<br /><br />The extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night. If the extensor lag is minimal (< 109) , leave the orthosis off for 3-4 one hour sessions during the day for light activity.<br /><br />7 Weeks Postop Exercises should address any residual extrinsic extensor tightness.<br /><br />Composite taping may be initiated 3-4 times a day for 20 minute sessions. This may eliminate the need for a custom-fabricated dynamic flexion orthosis. Once taped, active and passive wrist motion may be performed:<br /><br />The extension orthosis may be left off 5-6 one hour sessions during the day for light activity, assuming the extensor lag is minimal(<1 0?)_<br /><br />Putty andlor a hand exerciser with rubber band traction may be added to maximize active flexion. 8 Weeks Postop Isolated EDC exercises against putty or isometric EDC exercises may be initiated to facilitate MP joint extension.<br /><br />The extension orthosis is worn * 3 times a day for one hour sessions and then at night. The patient may return to all activities, with the exception of those activities requiring a tight grasp against resistance or sports. 9 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis is worn at night only. 10 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis is worn every other night: The patient may return to all ADLs. Sports and activities demanding a power grip are delayed until 12- 16 weeks postop.<br /><br />11 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis is discontinued.<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS When MP joint extensor lags are greater than 209 it is recommended to reduce the exercise sessions for a few days andlor prioritize forceful active extension to gradually resolve the notable extensors addition, NMES can be effective for improving extensor tendon gliding: lag: In<br /><br />164<br /><br />
