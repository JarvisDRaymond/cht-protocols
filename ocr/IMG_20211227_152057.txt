<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS FLEXOR POLLICIS LONGUS REPAIR</h1>
[INDIANA EARLY PASSIVE MOTION PROGRAM]<br /><br />INDICATIONS The Indiana Early Passive Motion program is recommended for two-strand or greater flexor tendon repairs.<br /><br />The passive program always precedes the early active program for four-strand or greater repairs:<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed:<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed: Edema control is applied consisting of an elastic bandage or elastic stockinette to the forearm and hand and 1 sterile gauze with 1" CobanTM or @ fingersock to the thumb.<br /><br />custom-fabricated dorsal blocking orthosis is fitted, positioning the wrist and hand as follows:<br /><br />Wrist: MP Joint: IP Joint:<br /><br />neutral 09-150 of flexion 300 of flexion<br /><br />PROM exercises are initiated within the restraints of the dorsal blocking orthosis 15 repetitions, 4-6 times a day: PROM exercises consist of passive flexion and extension of the IPJ, the MPJ and compositely to the entire thumb within the DBO [Patient Handout]<br /><br />10 - 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed.<br /><br />Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated.<br /><br />Ultrasound may be initiated to influence the scar formation.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop Light active flexion and extension may be initiated to the thumb, within the DBO. The exercise is performed 25 repetitions, 4-6 times a day:<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop NMES may be initiated to facilitate excursion of the FPL, assuming the patient can report exercising regularly since AROM exercises were initiated:<br /><br />AROM exercises may be initiated without the orthosis. This includes AROM to the wrist and to the thumb Initially for extension, gentle active extension is performed to gently mobilize adhesions distally. The orthosis is worn between exercise sessions and at night:<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking orthosis is discontinued.<br /><br />The following exercises are initiated: PROM to the wrist Gentle passive extension to the thumb. Begin with the MP joint in flexion while gently extending the IP joint. Gradually increase extension to include wrist extension combined with extension of the thumb MPJ and IPJ: Blocking exercises to the thumb MP and IP joints. For the IP joint, position the MP joint in + 309 flexion to perform the blocking: Blocking is not performed the first exercise session of the day and it is the last exercise performed each exercise session:<br /><br />A custom-fabricated wrist and thumb static extension orthosis may be fabricated to gradually resolve any EFT or flexion contracture at the MP or IP joint: The orthosis may be worn 2-3 times during the day for 20-30 minute sessions.<br /><br />226<br /><br />
