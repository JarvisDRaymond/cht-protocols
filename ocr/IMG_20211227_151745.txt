10 A 14 Days Postop [continued] be initiated. Once the incision site and wound are completely healed, scar massage with lotion may tightness is & major Ultrasound may be an option in the early postop phase, as severe extrinsic extensor concern: Early US may favorably influence the scar tissue.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop The orthoses are adjusted to allow active flexion at the MP joint level to 609 . Active-assisted extension is permitted within the restraints of the rubber-band traction and forearm based flexion stop. In addition; AROM to the wrist may be initiated so long as the digits are held in extension during the ROM exercises:<br /><br />Gentle scar mobilization/retraction is initiated, so long as the wound is completely healed:<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop AROM exercises are initiated out of the outrigger and blocking orthoses each 2 hours for 10 minute sessions. Those exercises include:<br /><br />Short-arc to mid-range active Transition tive dexion; folowed by forcefulactive extension: to full active flexion within days: Composite active flexion and extension in a tenodesis movement pattern Active digital extension with the wrist in neutral or slight flexion Isolated active extension of the index and small fingers (i.e. EIP and EDQM) , particularly important with lacerations to the index and small AROM to the wrist Gentle AAROM for wrist flexion Isolated EDC exercises with the IP joints flexed<br /><br />1 The custom-fabricated forearm based wrist and MP joint extension orthosis is adjusted to a hand based extension orthosis to wear between exercise sessions and at night. [Note: Be sure the MPJs are in full extension ] The orthosis may be removed 3-4 one hour sessions during the day for light activities. NMES may be initiated. To isolate the EDC can be quite effective in mobilizing the EDC through dense adhesions: To use NMES 3-4 times a day during this time frame is beneficial. Adaitional exercises include: composite active flexion of the wrist and hand (to begin addressing extrinsic extensor tightness) , along with isolated passive flexion of the wrist. 5 Weeks Postop The forearm based extension orthosis is removed for 5-6 one hour sessions a day for light activity. Self-passive exercises may be initiated for the wrist. Weeks Postop PROM exercises may be initiated for the wrist and digits. Initially, it is isolated passive flexion of each joint. Within 3-4 recommended to begin with days, add attempt to recapture composite passive flexion composite passive flexion. An overzealous quickly will likely resultin creating an extensor the adhesions have not been gradually mobilized and elongated. lag where Dorsal taping may be initiated 2-3 times a day for 20 minute sessions, the wrist while taped. along with simultaneous AROM of The forearm based wrist and MP joint orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night. A dynamic flexion orthosis may be initiated to the wrist or to the digits. times a day for 30 minute sessions. Typically, this would be worn 4-6 177<br /><br />
