<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES to V DELAYED MOBILIZATION</h1>
INDICATIONS The primary indications for delayed mobilization include Ihe unreliable patient patients with significant soff tissue injury or concomitant crush injuries and patients that have difficulty understanding the exercises; In addition; this would include the patient that does not seem to be taking the surgery seriously and indicates it is unlikelly they will actively participate in the exercises and wear the orthosis In these instances, it is in the best interest of the patient to simply immobilize the wrist and hand in a dorsal blocking orthosis (or & cast, if necessary) and reduce the risk of rupturing the repair: An additional indication for a delayed mobilization program would be young children who cannot participate in the passive range of motion exercise program ; Typically, children under the age of 9 will be better served with complete immobilization (long arm orthosis with the elbow 908 of flexion the forearm component in neutral; the wrist slightly extended, the MPJs in 609 of flexion and the IPJs just slightly flexed) , as opposed to attempting the early motion exercises. POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 5 - 7 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed. An initial evaluation is performed. An elastic stockinette is applied to the forearm and wrist. Digital level edema control is initiated with 1" sterile gauze and a fingersock or 1 CobanTm A custom-fabricated dorsal blocking orthosis is fitted for continual wear in the following position: Wrist: +259 extension MP Joints: 600 flexion IP Joints: extended<br /><br />Patient education is emphasized. The patient must understand the orthosis must be worn at all times and the patient must not use the hand for any ADLs or other functional tasks with the hand as the risk for tendon rupture heightens. Document the patient education:<br /><br />10 4 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed:<br /><br />Once the incision site is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated:<br /><br />3 ~ 3'2 Weeks Postop Passive and AROM exercises are initiated within the dorsal blocking orthosis. Initially, the patient performs 25 repetitions of passive flexion and extension in a composite fashion: This is followed by 25 repetitions of gentle AROM within the restraints of the orthosis  [Patient Handout] If passive flexion is limited, a custom-fabricated dynamic flexion orthosis may be added to the existing orthosis to increase passive PIP joint and DIP joint flexion. To wear the orthosis 3 times a day for 20 minutes is often adequate_<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop NMES may be initiated within 2-3 days of beginning AROM: [Note: NMES is not recommended with children:]<br /><br />5 Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking orthosis is worn between exercise sessions and at night.<br /><br />AROM exercises are initiated out of the orthosis each two hours, 25 repetitions. The exercises include: AROM to the wrist, with the digits relaxed Light active flexion and gentle active extension of the digits. Gentle extension is performed to gradually mobilize the adhesions distally: Active flexion into a fist, followed by active MP joint extension while maintaining the PIP and DIP joints in flexion (as best as possible) and following this with extension [hook-fist exercise]<br /><br />218<br /><br />
