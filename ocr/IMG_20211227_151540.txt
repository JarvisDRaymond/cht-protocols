<h1>Chapler 17; EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIR ZONE IV DELAYED MOTION</h1>
POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 P 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dlressing is removed<br /><br />An initial evalualion is performed, An elastic stockinette to Ihe forearm dnd hand is (llted, along wilh dligilal level edema control consisting of 1 sterile gauze, 1 I CobanTM or fingersocks.<br /><br />A custom-fabricated extension orthosis is fitted posilioning Ihe PIP and DIP joints in full extension for continual wear;<br /><br />10 _ 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed:<br /><br />Within 48 hours following suture removal, scar massage with lotion may be initiated 3-4 times & day for 3- 5 minutes.<br /><br />Edema control may include 1 CobanTM or fingersocks.<br /><br />The orthosis is assessed, ensuring the PIP joint is in full extension:<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop AROM exercises are initiated to the digit. Emphasis is placed on short-arc to mid-arc flexion, along with forceful active extension the initial week of exercise. The purpose is to gently mobilize the adhesions and minimize the risk of an extensor lag: In addition, blocking exercises to the PIP and DIP joints and isolated PIP joint extension with the MP joint blocked in flexion (reverse blocking) are initiated. Exercises are performed 4-6 times a day, 25 repetitions [Patient Handout]<br /><br />Consider applying Kinesio@ Tape along the dorsal aspect of the digit with the digit in full extension: This will assist with digital extension and aid in mobilizing the dorsal surface scar while performing ROM exercises: Too, when applied both dorsally and volarly it can help decrease edema:<br /><br />The extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night.<br /><br />5 Weeks Postop Begin performing full-arc AROM exercises:<br /><br />The extension orthosis is removed for 3 one hour sessions during the day to perform light activities.<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis is removed for 4 one hour sessions during the day: Self-passive ROM exercises may be initiated to the digit assuming the extensor lag is less than 10?, Initially, this is begun with isolated passive flexion to the PIP joint with the MP joint extended. 7 Weeks Postop Dorsal or cornposite taping may be initiated 2-3 times & day for 20 minute sessions, so long as active PIPJ extension is <10" .<br /><br />A custom-fabricated dynaric flezion orthosis may be iniliated as needed. The dynamic orthosis should immobilize the MPJ in ertension with the dynamic traction specilic to the PIP joint. Typically, the orthosis is vyorn 3-4 tires & day for 20 minute sessions, It is Important to monitor for an extensor adjust the orthosis wearing schedule accordingly: Iag and The extension orthosis is removed for 6 one hour sessions @ day and at night: 8 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis is worn for 3 one hour sessions a day and at night: Putty or a hand exerciser with rubber band traction may be iniliated.<br /><br />158<br /><br />
