<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS EARLY MOTION F ZONES V & VI</h1>INDICATIONS The early motion program for extensor tendon repairs is indicated for complex extensor tendon injuries in which the periosteum is violated or the soft tissue is extensively involved with Zone V or VI lacerations and repairs. Another indication for the early motion program is rigid fixation of any metacarpal fracture in the area of Zone VI, with a concomitant extensor tendon injury.<br /><br />This therapy program is not necessary for simple lacerations. Typically, straight forward extensor tendon repairs have excellent results with a 4 week immobilization program prior to commencing active range of motion exercises.<br /><br />RATIONALE 7 THERAPY PROGRAM The early motion program permits a minimum of 3-5mm of extensor tendon excursion, which is believed to be sufficient to prevent dense peritendinous adhesions from blocking tendon gliding: In all likelihood, without early motion the extensor tendons would become severely adherent to bone and subcutaneous tissue. In complement to this, the early motion favorably influences the orientation of the collagen fibers along the tendons.<br /><br />By permitting 309-350 of MP joint flexion, this helps minimize the likelihood of MP joint contractures by allowing the collateral ligaments some degree of tension. AROM decreases edema, maintains soft tissue elasticity and promotes healing: POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed.

Active and PROM exercises are performed to the IP joints twice a These exercises are performed once in the morning day, 25 repetitions, while in the before applying the outrigger (which is worn during the day) and once later in the afternoon or evening: 10 = 5 14 Days Postop Once the sutures are removed and the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion, along addition, scar retraction is performed:. Scar massage with lotion is encouraged 3-4 times a day: with applying a scar pad (e.g; Otoform KTM, Rolyan 50/50TM or Rolyan@Ezemix@) may be initiated. In 166<br /><br />
