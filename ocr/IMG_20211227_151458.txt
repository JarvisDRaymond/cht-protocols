A custom-fabricated extension orthosis is fitted positioning the PIP joint in fUll extension for continual wear. If the PIPJ cannot be held in 0" of extension due to edema, include the MP and DIP joints as needed to ensure full extension initially.<br /><br />AROM of the DIP joint is permitted:<br /><br />second orthosis is fabricated positioning the PIP and DIP joints in 309 of flexion. This orthosis is Used with the "short arc motion (SAM)" exercise program:<br /><br />With the straps removed from the second orthosis, the orthosis is positioned to permit full active extension of the PIP and DIP joints and +309 of active flexion at the PIP joint level: Exercises are performed 4-6 times a day 15 repetitions.<br /><br />10 Days Postop The sutures are removed.<br /><br />Within 48 hours following suture removal (assuming the incision site is healed) , scar mobilization techniques are initiated. This may include scar massage with lotion, along with applying a scar pad:<br /><br />Edema control consists of 1 CobanTM or fingersocks.<br /><br />The extension orthosis, worn between exercise sessions and at night, should include only the PIP joint by this time frame_<br /><br />2 Weeks Postop The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 459 flexion, so long as the active PIPJ extension is <5'.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop The exercise orthosis is adjusted to 609 flexion, so long as the active PIPJ extension is <59 .<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop The ezercise orthosis is adjusted to 909 flexion, so long as active PIPJ extension is S5". Following 2-3 days of exercise in this arc of motion, assuming the extensor lag is $ 109, the exercise orthosis may be discontinued. Gentle composite active flexion and extension may be initiated  Emphasis is placed on blocking the MP joint in * 45" of flexion and actively extending the PIP joint. If the MP joint tends to hyperertend with active extension; @ blocking orthosis positioning the MP joint in flexion can be fabricated for exercise sessions;<br /><br /> epersion digda Applying Gevel Kir Kinesiom Tape The oki Ihe dorsum oxereisdigi hs In full extension igulethaist with and serves mobilize skin wilh ROM exercises, passive digital for these authors. simple technique proved valuable 6 Weeks Postop Isolated passive flexion to the PIP joint, wilh Ihe MP joint extended, Is iniliated, The extension orthosis is removed for 3 one hour sessions during the extensor lag is S1O?. day for light aclivilies, assuming the 152<br /><br />
