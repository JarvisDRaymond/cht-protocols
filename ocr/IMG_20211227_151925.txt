<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES to IV EARLY PASSIVE MOBILIZATION (INDIANA MODIFIED DURAN PROGRAM) [continued]</h1>
6 Weeks Postop [continued] Note; Blocking is not permilted to the small finger: It has been the experience of these authors that blocking to the DIP joint comes wilh Ihe risk of tendon rupture. [Note: In part, this risk is due to the diameter of the profundus tendon, the vascularity and limited tendon gliding risking tendon adherence ] A review of the literature has shown clearly that the rupture rate with the small finger is markedly higher than the adjacent digits. Therefore, the authors do not perform blocking to the DIP joint with flexor tendon repairs of the small finger no exception. A custom-fabricated extension orthosis may be initiated in full active extension to the PIP joint and without passive extension force to the DIP joint, The orthosis is worn at night only or 2-3 times during the day for 20 minute to 30 minute sessions.<br /><br />Patient education remains vital. The patient must understand that a tight sustained grip with or without weighted resistance greatly increases the risk of rupture during the early healing of the flexor tendon repairs.<br /><br />Buddy tapes are worn between the involved digit(s) and an adjacent digit. Light use of the hand is encouraged:<br /><br />The patient is encouraged to wear the forearm based DBO when in crowds.<br /><br />7 Weeks Postop A custom-fabricated dynamic extension orthosis may be fitted if a PIP joint flexion contracture has developed: The MP joint is positioned in * 450 flexion with the dynamic traction along the middle phalanx: This is particularly important for PIP joint contractures that tend to develop in the small finger: Typically, the orthosis is worn 3-4 times a day for 20 minute to 30 minute sessions. Gradually increasing composite passive extension at the MPJ, PIPJ and DIPJ may be initiated. 8 Weeks Postop Toenhance tendon gliding; light resistance may be introduced with putty and gradually transitioning to a hand exerciser (with light rubber bands) over a period of 1-2 weeks The putty is formed into a cylinder shape for squeezing as opposed to a large, round ball: Note: No heavy use of the hand is allowed at this time.<br /><br />10 F 12 Weeks Postop The hand may be Used in all activities of daily living: The typical weight restriction for the involved hand is * 5 pounds:<br /><br />14 -16 Weeks Postop Heavy lifting is permitted by four months.<br /><br />16 I 20 Weeks Postop Activities requiring @ tight, sustained grip against resistance are delayed until 4-6 months   This is particularly true with the small finger: CONSIDERATIONS Tbenereafergaiciic ROMicare obtained between 4 and 7 weeks Therefore; it is important to ke theratienteactive participation in the therapy program during these crilical fourweeks Toen emphasize key time frame for frequent therapy visits to carefully monitor this is the accordingly. progress and Patients that heal quickly and form dense adjust the treatment plan accelerate their treatment scar tissue will require adjustment to slightly plan; while those that have excellent AROM early; will require their treatment program to be delayed as those individuals are not forming dense scar tissue.
