<h1>Chapter 31: NERVE REPAIRS MEDIAN NERVE REPAIR [WRIST to FOREARM LEVEL] [continued]</h1> 8 Weeks Postop Stcengthening with hand-held weights may be initiated: To begin with 1-3 pounds and progress to 4-6 pounds over & month should be adequate to gradually rebuila endurance and initial strength for the wrist, forearm, elbow and shoulder: +12 Weeks Postop A work conditioning program is recommended for patients returning to work Where the job requires significant strength or fine motor skills, and/or to assess for alternative job duties. CONSIDERATIONS NMES can be effective in noting the early return of motor function by stimulating the thenar muscles (OP , APB , superficial head of the FPB) and the radial lumbricals. The earliest these authors have noted early re-innervation is between 3 & 4 months post repair. Recovery of intrinsic motor function is not common in adults. Secondary tendon transfers may be indicated.<br /><br />first web spacer is recommended for night wear (1-2 nights a week) until thenar function returns or tendon transfers are performed. Otherwise, there is risk of a first web space contracture gradually evolving: Typically, this is not fitted until the DBO is discontinued.<br /><br />Patient education is critical regarding sensory impairment: Patients must be sure their vision is not occluded as they attempt to use their hand: Without adequate sensibility, the patient could re-injure their hand while performing daily activities and work tasks.<br /><br />Typically, an isolated nerve laceration does not occur at the wrist or forearm level. Usually, the wrist and flexor tendons are also involved: Refer to Chapter 21 on flexor tendon repairs in Zone V to feveewhe review postoperative course of rehabilitation.<br /><br /><br /><br />
