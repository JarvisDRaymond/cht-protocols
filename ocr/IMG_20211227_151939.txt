<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES to IV</h1>
EARLY ACTIVE MOTION (INDIANA PROGRAM)<br /><br />SURGICAL PROCEDURE Early active motion programs are reserved for strong flexor tendon repairs. In order to consider an early active motion program; a four-strand flexor tendon repair (or greater) is typically performed: For the flexor tendon repair to have at least 45 newtons of linear breaking strengih is preferred. The repair strength includes the combined strength of the repair, the peripheral suture, and suture material size (.e 3-0). In complement to the actual repair strength; the WOF and GR must be limited (e.g: minimal edema, supple passive flexion, pulley vented, slip of FDS excised). The original Indiana repair for early active flexion included & Tajima "core" suture plus horizontal mattress four strand repair, with running lock peripheral suture: There are a wide variety of repair options for four-strand, six-strand and eight-strand repairs. In addition, bone anchors and buttons, among other types of repairs are indications for early motion. Again, it is important to know the repair strength : This allows the therapist to determine the most favorable therapy program that would limit the risk of tendon rupture.<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 -5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed: An initial evaluation is performed. Great care should be taken to carefully measure the edema along the proximal phalanx of the involved digit and the same digit of the opposite hand: Ensuring the edema diminishes each visit is important for ensuring the edema control is effective: The less edema present, the better is the opportunity for a quality outcome: [Note: Edema greater than Zmm the opposite digit PI is placed back into a compressive dressing for 2-3 additional days before re- evaluating edema and whether early active motion may be initiated: ] An elastic bandage is applied to the hand and forearm, along with digital level edema control utilizing 1 sterile gauze and fingersocks or 1 CobanTm [Note: It has been documented in the literature that 3- 5 days postop is the ideal time frame to initiate early motion. Work by Manske and others have shown that the force demands on the flexor tendons (work of flexion) are less when therapy is initiated at 3 days. Other authors have advocated 5-7 days before initiating ROM:] A custom-fabricated dorsal blocking orthosis (DBO) is fitted to be worn at all times, except during the place and hold active exercises. The orthosis positions the wrist in t 250 of extension, the MP joints in 459_ 609 of flexion and the IP joints in neutral: The Indiana Modified Duran exercise program is performed within the orthosis. [Patient Handout] The exercises are performed 4-6 times a day, 15 repetitions.<br /><br />While in therapy, the therapist performs a modification of the modified synergistic exercise advocated by Amadio and colleagues. This consists of removing the orthosis, placing the forearm on the tabletop palm up, wrist neutral; and performing the following exercise: composite passive digital flexion (all digits) followed by bringing the MP joints into extension while maintaining full passive IP joint flexion. This is followed by returning to full passive composite flexion. 15 slow repetitions are performed. [Note: This specific exercise is performed for zones and II FTRs, not zones IIl and IV:] [Note: The patient does not perform this exercise.]<br /><br />5 - 7 Days Postop In complement to the dorsal blocking orthosis, @ custom-fabricated wrist tenodesis orthosis is fitted. This orthosis has a hinge to serve as the mobile wrist component. The hinge allows full wrist flexion and limits wrist extension to & maximum of 309-459 of extension. The MP joints are positioned in 459-608 of flexion and the IP joints are in neutral:<br /><br />Following the Indiana Modified Duran Exercises the patient transitions from the DBO to the tenodesis wrist orthosis to perform the place and hold exercises. This exercise consists of passively flexing the digits in a composite fashion and beginning light active flexion of the digits while simultaneously bringing the wrist into extension: As the patient is reaching the wrist extended position; the patient actively attempts to maintain a light active fist with @ gentle muscle contraction, for 5 seconds. This is followed by relaxing the wrist and letting the wrist drop back into flexion: [Note: As an alternative to the separate wrist hinged orthosis, these authors have found it effective to perform the tenodesis exercises within the DBO by removing the digital and hand straps, thereby allowing the wrist to drop into flexion and then passively flex the digits while extending the wrist with the DBO and performing light active flexion:]<br /><br />214<br /><br />
