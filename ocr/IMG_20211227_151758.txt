<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS EXTENSOR POLLICIS LONGUS (EPL) REPAIR</h1>
POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed. An elastic stockinette is applied to the hand and forearm; along with 1" CobanTM or fingersock for the thumb A custom-fabricated wrist and thumb static orthosis is fitted with the wrist in 202 of extension, the thumb midway between palmar and radial abduction; MP joint in extension and the IP joint in slightly hyperextension:<br /><br />10 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed.<br /><br />Once the wound is healed, scar massage with lotion is initiated: To perform scar massage 3-4 times & day is encouraged.<br /><br />Manual desensitization exercises are initiated 3-4 times & day: For proximally based lacerations, it is not uncommon for the patient to report some degree of hypersensitivity near the area of the superficial branch of the radial nerve. [Patient Handout]<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop Gentle AROM may be initiated to the wrist while allowing the thumb to relax in extension. To exercise the wrist 3-4 times & day, 25 repetitions, is recommended.<br /><br />Moist heat for 5 minutes prior to exercise provides pain relief and enhances the flexibility of the joints and soft tissue structures.<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop AROM exercises are initiated to the wrist and separately to the thumb t 6 times & day; 25 Begin with mid-range active flexion/extension the initial 3-4 days of exercise and then repetitions: motion: One exercise that is particularly effective for progress to full-arc enhancing EPL thumb MP joint in slight flexion, and excursion is to position the wrist and attempt full active IP extension of the thumb. exercise to emphasize with each and every exercise session: This is an important Review with the giving a greater effortin active extension compared to active patient the importance of flexion; to maximize active IPJ extension: NMES may be initiated to facilitate EPL tendon gliding: Ultrasound may be added to influence the suppleness of the scar to enhance tendon gliding: 5 Weeks Postop the EPhe AROM exercises, add composite active wrist and thumb the EPL and to mobilize adhesions/increase tendon flexion to gradually resolve any EET of gliding: Add self-passive wrist flexion exercises: The wrist and thumb static orthosis is reduced to a thumb extension orthosis, with the 6 Weeks wrist free. Postop Add self-passive flexion to the thumb. During the initial 2-3 teparatelvtisolate the thumb MP joint and the IP joint  days of PROM, the passive flexion should thumb at this point; this allows adhesiondo Bobiioeding composite passive flexion "stretching out' gendly be mbilzed and will help minimize  of the the repair where the tendon may be adhered; the risk of The thumb orthosis may be left off for 3 one hour sessions during the day 7 for light ADLs. Weeks Postop Combined passive flexion of stretches the wrist and thumb is initiated (15-30 seconds) is beneficial. Heat before to resolve the any EET . Slow stretching exercisests motion, long encouraged:<br /><br />179<br /><br />
