3 - 5 Days Postop ORTHOSIS 5 WEARING SCHEDULE The wearing schedule for the orthosis(es) is as follows: RME only 4-6 weeks full-time wear RME t wrist orthosis initial 3 weeks, between 3-6 weeks RME only orthosis, unless engaged in "at risk" work/sport then add wrist orthosis as determined by therapist Isurgeon. Recommendation: For those wearing the RME only orthosis initially, discourage the patient from simultaneous wrist and finger flexion:<br /><br />Most therapists wean patients from the RME orthosis between 4-6 weeks Vs. abruptly stopping orthosis wear.<br /><br />EXERCISES After the orthosis(es)are fabricated and custom-fitted, initiate active ROM exercises. Exercises should be patient-centered, dependent on the clinical assessment. It is recommended during the initial 3 weeks after repair, that exercises be done wearing the RME orthosis.<br /><br />Exercises for all zones may include: Active flexion of all MCP joints with PIP/DIP joints extended Active PIP/DIP flexion with MCP joints extended (hook fist) Active composite MCP + PIP + DIP joint flexion (regular fist) Active composite MCP + PIP + DIP joint extension Place and hold MCP + PIP + DIP extension<br /><br />Zones IV-VI wrist exercises are added 2 weeks after repair Active wrist flexion in RME orthosis fingers relaxed Active wrist extension with fingers flexed in RME orthosis Zone VII wrist exercises are added at 11-14 days after repair if extensor tendon tethers at retinaculum andlor active extensor lag develops In RME orthosis flex wrist 359 then gentle active regular fist In RME orthosis extend wrist to neutral then actively extend the fingers compositely FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES Encourage patients to use their hand immediately for light functional activities<br /><br />Remember, everyday tasks become exercise while wearing the RME plus wrist orthosis or RME only orthosis.<br /><br />In the RME plus wrist orthosis or RME only orthosis the following guidelines for hand use are suggested 0-3 weeks light use progressing to medium use (<20 pounds bilateral hand tasks) 3-8 weeks L medium use, progressing to heavy Use Hand washing: When approved by the therapist/surgeon a pencil/tongue depressor can be used to retain the position of relative MCP joint extension during hand washing and orthosis care. Bathing When approved by the therapist/surgeon the RME only orthosis can be worn in the shower provided wrist flexion during the initial 3 weeks after repair is avoided. After showering use a pencil to keep the position of relative MCP joint extension while drying the hand and orthosis.<br /><br />170<br /><br />
