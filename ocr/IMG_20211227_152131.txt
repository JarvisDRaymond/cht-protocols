POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 10 5 14 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed:<br /><br />The sutures are removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed. Edema control consists of an elastic bandage or elastic stockinette to the forearm and hand and 1" sterile gauze with 1 CobanTM or a fingersock to the thumb.<br /><br />custom-fabricated dorsal blocking orthosis is fitted, positioning the wrist and hand as follows:<br /><br />Wrist: MP Joint: IP Joint:<br /><br />neutral 0o-150 of flexion 300 of flexion<br /><br />Scar massage with lotion may be initiated once the wound is completely healed.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop Passive and active flexion and active extension exercises are initiated within the restraints of the dorsal blocking orthosis 25 repetitions, 4-6 times a day:<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop NMES may be initiated to facilitate excursion of the FPL, assuming the patient can report exercising regularly the initial 2-3 days with the AROM exercises.<br /><br />AROM exercises may be initiated without the orthosis  This includes AROM to the wrist and to the thumb. Gentle extension is performed initially to gradually mobilize the adhesions and improve tendon gliding: 6 Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking orthosis is discontinued:<br /><br />The following exercises are initiated: APROM exercises are initiated for the wrist. Full arc active flexion and extension is initiated to the thumb. Gentle passive extension may be initiated to the thumb. Begin with the MP joint in flexion while attempting passive IPJ extension. Blocking exercises may be initiated to the thumb IP joint. Begin by positioning the MP jointin t 300 flexion while beginning the blocking , Blocking exercises are not performed the first exercise session of the day and they are the last exercise performed exercise session; each<br /><br />A custom-fabricated wrist and thumb static extension orthosis may be fabricated to gradually resolve any extrinsic flexor tightness of the FPL or flexion contracture at the MP or IP joint.
