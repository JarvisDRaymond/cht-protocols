<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONE V</h1>
INDIANA EARLY PASSIVE MOTION PROGRAM<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed.<br /><br />A light compressive dressing is applied to the hand and forearm, along with digital level fingersocks or CobanTm;<br /><br />A custom-fabricated forearm based dorsal blocking orthosis is fitted for continual wear: The wrist and hand are positioned as follows:<br /><br />Wrist: MP Joints: IP Joints:<br /><br />150-200 extension 459-600 flexion full extension<br /><br />Within the restraints of the dorsal blocking orthosis, composite passive flexion and extension exercises are performed to the digits 15 repetitions, 3-4 times a day: [Note: Isolated passive flexion/extension of the DIP and PIP joints individually are not necessary as the PROM does not generate independent passive tendon gliding of the FDS and FDP along the repair site:]<br /><br />One additional exercise may be performed in therapy only. The exercise is a modification of the modified synergistic exercise advocated by Tanaka, Amadio and colleagues: The forearm (supinated) is rested on the tabletop with the wrist in neutral extension. The therapist performs composite passive flexion of the digits:  This is followed with slowly and gently bringing the MP joints into 09 of extension while simultaneously keeping the IP Js flexed. The therapist repeats the exercise 10 repetitions slowly. NEVER are the IP Js allowed to extend during this exercise.<br /><br />10 4 14 Days Postop The sutures or staples are removed.<br /><br />Within 48 hours following suture removal, assuming the wound is completely healed, scar mobilization techniques may be initiated: This may include scar massage with lotion, along with applying a scar pad at night (e.g. Rolyan 50/50TM, Otoform KTM):<br /><br />Ultrasound may be initiated at any time with the goal of enhancing the elasticity of the underlying peritendinous adhesions to promote tendon excursion and promote tendon healing: Itis common to have dense adhesions along the injury and surgical site.<br /><br />In complete to the PROM exercises for the digits, isolated passive wrist flexion/extension within the restraints of the DBO are permitted . The hand and digital straps are temporarily removed to perform the passive wrist motion, 3 times & day, 15 slow repetitions 3 Weeks Postop AROMexercises are initiated to the digits within the restraints of the dorsal blocking orthosis 4-6 times a day, 25 repetitions Separately, AROM may be initiated for the wrist, within the restraints of the DBO. The patient is encouraged to sleep no more than 6-8 hours without an exercise session: 4 Weeks Postop Within 2 .3,days of beginning AROM, NMES may be initiated to facilitate tendon gliding: is used 2-3 times & Typically, NMES day for 15 minute sessions; A custom-fabricated Wrist and MP joint blocking orthosis may be added on the volar side of the dorsal blocking orthosis to isolate the PIP and DIP joints for gentle aclive flexion: 4 Yz Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking orthosis is worn between exercise sessions and at night. [Note: In the presence of an associated nerve repair at the wrist level, exercises are continued within the restraints of the blocking orthosis ] In the absence of a nerve repaisemid-eange ROM (t30"he1cybeipeitecdorc wrist. for the<br /><br />234<br /><br />
