<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES to IV</h1>
EARLY PASSIVE MOBILIZATION (INDIANA MODIFIED DURAN PROGRAM)<br /><br />SURGICAL PROCEDURE Two-strand flexor tendon repairs cre an indlicalion for an early passive range of motion program; such as the Indiana Modified Duran Program; Two-strand repalrs are nol placed on an early active flexion program at Ihe Indiana Hand to Shoulder Center.<br /><br />The early PROM program may be used for all lypes of Ilexor tendon repairs. In the presence of 4 - 6 - 8 strand repairs, Ihe opportunily to achieve qualily passive tendon glide through the pulleys greatly diminishes. The Indiana Modified Duran Program is always performed prior to beginning the early active motion program to achieve maximum passive flexion, reduce edema, influence the orientation of new connective tissue and strenglh of the repair. It is vitally important for Ihe therapist to be familiar with the strength of the repair to establish the optimal rehabilitation program and adjust the course of therapy during subsequent weeks.<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed.<br /><br />For hand and forearm edema control a 2" elastic bandage is applied, along with 1 sterile gauze and fingersocks or CobanTM to the involved digit(s) . [Note: Should edema be substantial (> Tmm circumferential PImeasurement of the involved digit compared to the same digit on the opposite hand) , consider reapplying a compressive dressing an additional day or two before initiating therapy: ]<br /><br />custom-fabricated forearm based dorsal blocking orthosis is fitted for continual wear. The dorsal blocking orthosis positions the wrist and hand as follows: Wrist: Slight extension + 259 MPs: 459-600 flexion PIPs/DIPs: full extension<br /><br />PROM exercises are initiated within the restraints of the orthosis 4-6 times a day.<br /><br />The PROM exercises include the following: [Patient Handout] 115 repetitions of passive flexion and extension to the PIP joint 115 repetitions of passive flexion and extension to the DIP joint  115 repetitions composite flexion and extension to the entire digit It is important to place equal emphasis on the passive extension and the passive flexion: It is through the effort of passive flexion followed by passive extension that allows the tendon(s) to glide distal from the repair site. The exercises should be performed precisely as demonstrated and with slow movements and gentle stretches at the end range. With passive extension of the digit(s) , be especially careful with passive DIPJ extension, ensuring the passive extension does not go beyond neutral, risking hyper- extension of the DIPJ. Be sure to have the patient demonstrate the exercises every therapy visit to ensure they are performing the exercises properly. Patient education is extremely important. The patient must understand the orthosis is protecting the tendon repair. To remove the orthosis for any type of light activity could risk tendon rupture. To provide written instructions regarding patient education is important, along with documenting the patient education:<br /><br />5 ~ 7 Day Postop Continue to place emphasis on excellent edema control at the digital level. The patient should demonstrate the exercises for the therapist each visit to therapy: Often, the patient does not perform the exercises properly.<br /><br />During therapy visits, the therapist may remove the dorsal blocking orthosis to begin a modified synergistic exercise similar to the exercise advocated by Tanaka, Amadio, Zhao Zobitz; and An (2005) . With the orthosis removed, the forearm rests on the tabletop in supination with the wrist in neutral. First , composite passive flexion of the digits is performed, followed by passive extension of the MP joints with 210<br /><br />
