<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS EARLY MOTION 4 ZONES VII & VIII [continued]</h1>
8 Weeks Postop Putty or a hand exerciser with rubber band traction may be added to maximize active flexion: If there is an extensor lag 2 159, continue the static orthosis at night; if not, wear the orthosis every other night until 10 weeks.<br /><br />10 Weeks Postop The forearm based extension orthosis is discontinued no later than 10-12 weeks postop.<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS Mid-range active ROM of the wrist is recommended at 3 weeks postop. An early motion program is highly recommended for extensor tendon repairs in zones VI, VII, or VIII where there is concomitant soft tissue loss or fractures. The program maximizes the opportunity for mobilization of the extensor tendons and reduces extrinsic extensor tightness.<br /><br />Itis important to recognize severe extrinsic extensor tightness is common with zone VII and VIII tendon repairs. Progressing the patient through therapy by methodically and consistently increasing the arc of motion at the wrist and then at the digital level is extremely important. To transition quickly from short-arc to mid-range and full-range active motion and to begin self-passive by isolating each individualjoint and in a progressive manner add composite motion is valuable. Due to the complexity of the program, this program is not advocated for simple lacerations, patients that may become easily confused or for whatever reason may be unreliable.<br /><br />The relative motion program by Julianne Howell for extensor tendon repairs has been extremely successful and requires a limited number of orthoses: In most cases, the relative motion program would be ideal:<br /><br />178<br /><br />
