<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONE V</h1>
INDIANA EARLY ACTIVE MOTION PROGRAM<br /><br />INDICATIONS The primary indications include: Reliable patient, believed will fully comply with the exercises and the wearing schedule with the orthosis (continual wear) Four-strand or greater repairs Strong two-strand repairs (with concomitant 3-0 suture material, quality peripheral suture), with highly skilled hand surgeon and therapist Tendon repairs, nerves spared Tendon & nerve repairs (limited tension on nerve repairs) POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 _ 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed: An initial evaluation is performed: With all follow Up visits, carefully document, monitor and ensure steady progress with all active digital flexion. In particular; ensuring steady gains with active flexion at the IPJ level is essential:<br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied to the hand and forearm; along with digital level fingersocks or CobanTm<br /><br />A custom-fabricated forearm based dorsal blocking orthosis is fitted for continual wear: The wrist and hand are positioned as follows:<br /><br />Wrist: 159-209 extension [Note: It is valuable to discuss with the surgeon what degree of wrist extension is permitted before placing tension on the nerve repair(s). Preferably, the wrist is positioned in 208 of extension:] MP Joints: 459-600 flexion IP Joints: full extension<br /><br />Within the restraints of the dorsal blocking orthosis (DBO) , composite passive flexion and extension are performed to the digits 25 repetitions, 3-4 times during the day: [Note: Isolating individual joints is not necessary CS this does not generate independent passive tendon gliding of the FDS and FDP along the repair site:] Passive wrist ROM is permitted, with passive flexion followed by extension to the wrist position within the DBO. Simply remove the hand and digital straps to gently perform the limited arc of passive wrist extension; along with full passive flexion (1 5 repetitions, 3-4 times a day). Certainly, do not permif digital motion while performing the wrist motion.<br /><br />In complement to the passive ROM exercises, it is recommended to begin light, active flexion. Ensure with the surgeon there is adequate repair strength to begin AROM.

This is repeated relaxing the hand and allowing the 15-25 repetitions: The exercise is performed 4-6 times a following the PROM: [Note: The place and hold exercises may be performed by day removing the aCroSs the hand/palm and the digits to permit a tenodesis effect by allowing strap into flexion, and then repeating the exercise by bringing the wrist into gravity to drop the wrist passive flexion, within the DBO]] extension and the digits into<br /><br />10 5 14 Days Postop The sutures or staples are removed:<br /><br />Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion minutes. may begin 3-4 times a In complement to the scar massage, a scar pad may be day for 3-5 Otoform KTM) .
