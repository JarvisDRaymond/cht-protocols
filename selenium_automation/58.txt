<h1>Chapler 21: FEXOR IENDON REPAIRS FLEXOR PollICIS IONGUS REPAIR INDIANA EARLY ACTIVE MOIon PROCRAM</h1>
INDICATIONS The Indliana early aclive mollon progralm Is recommendlod for pallenls who have uridlergone surgical repair of the Ilexor polllcis longus wilh a four-slrand or gredler london repalr,<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing Is removed,<br /><br />An inilial evalualion is performed:<br /><br />An elastic stockinette or an elaslic bandage is applied to Ihe hand and foredrm, dlong with 1 sterile gauze and fingersocks or 1 CobanTm to Ihe Ihumb<br /><br />The patient is fitted with a custom-fabricated forearm based dorsal blocking orthosis. The dorsal blocking orthosis positions the wrist and thumb as follows:<br /><br />Wrist: MP Joint: IP Joint:<br /><br />0" of flexion [Repairs typically on tension; avoid wrist extension] 0-150 of flexion 309 of flexion<br /><br />PROM exercises are performed within the restraints of the dorsal blocking orthosis.  The exercises consist of the Indiana Early Passive Motion program (Modified Duran type program). This includes passive flexion/extension separately to the IP joint and MP joint, along with composite passive flexion/extension of the thumb within the orthosis. Exercises are performed 4-6 times & day, 15 repetitions. [Patient Handout]<br /><br />5 - 7 Days Postop Once the edema has diminished and the patient is passively supple, the early active flexion exercise may be performed: This is performed in a custom-fabricated wrist tenodesis orthosis, which positions the wrist and thumb as follows: Wrist: Hinge component permits full wrist flexion and extension to 259 MP Joint: 0%-150 of flexion IP Joint 300 of flexion<br /><br />The tenodesis exercises are performed following the passive exercises. The patient transitions to the tenodesis orthosis, making sure to maintain wrist flexion during the transition. While wearing the tenodesis orthosis, the Uninvolved hand brings the wrist into extension while simultaneously flexing the thumb passively. As the wrist is extended and the thumb is being passively flexed, the patient begins to lightly and actively flex the thumb. After the count of five, the patient is instructed to relax the thumb and wrist and allow the wrist to drop into flexion: This tenodesis exercise is repeated 15 repetitions, 4-6 times a day. [Patient Handout]<br /><br />[Note; In place of the hinged wrist tenodesis orthosis, the patient may remove the straps to the hand and thurb frorn the forearm based DBO to perform the same movement pattern. With the straps reroved frorn the hand and thumb, the wrist is extended while passively flexing the thumb and generating light active flezion of the thumb  Once the flexed position is held for approximately 5 seconds, the hand relazes, the wrist drops into flexion and the movement pattern Is repeated. 10  3 14 Days Postop Within 48 hours following suture rernoval, assuring the wound is healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated.<br /><br />The PROM and tenodesis ezercises are conlinued 4-6 Ilmes & day wilhin Ihe orthoses,<br /><br />Ultrasound may be initiated, If may be parlicularly benellcial for Ihe pallent known to form dense scar. 4 Weeks Postop NMES may be initiated to facilitate excursion of Ihe FPL,<br /><br />228<br /><br />
