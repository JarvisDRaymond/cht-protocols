<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES to IV EARLY PASSIVE MOBILIZATION (INDIANA MODIFIED DURAN PROGRAM) [conllnued]</h1>
5 - 7 Days Postop [continued] the PIP and DIP joints flexed  Slow; gentle stretches are performed  This permils passive glide of Ine profundus with negligible force on the repair, Repeat for 10 repelilions [Perforred In therapy ONLY) 10 4 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed;<br /><br />Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated; scar pad maybe applied for night wear:<br /><br />The PROM exercises are continued within the restraints of the orthosis.<br /><br />Ultrasound may be initiated at any time to favorably influence the scar tissue, being careful to limit the thermal effect:<br /><br />With limited passive flexion; a custom-fabricated dynamic flexion assist may be added to the volar portion of the dorsal blocking orthosis   This may be worn for 5" to 10" prior to each exercise session:<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop In complement to the passive ROM exercises, active flexion and extension exercises may be initiated within the orthosis 15 repetitions, 4-6 times & day: This includes active place and hold exercises followed by active flexion and active extension within the orthosis. [Patient Handout]<br /><br />With each therapy visit, carefully measure composite AROM at the PIP and DIP level. It is vitally important to make steady gains in active flexion.<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking orthosis is removed 4-6 times & day for AROM exercises. The exercises include: [Patient Handout] Active wrist flexion/extension with the digits relaxed Place and hold active flexion (allowing light active flexion while passively bringing the digits into flexion) Composite active flexion, followed by gentle active extension (to gradually mobilize the adhesions during extension) Composite active flexion followed by MP joint extension with the IP joints flexed, and concluding with active PIP and DIP joint extension [hook-fist exercise] The patient may remove the orthosis to perform the modification of the synergistic exercise advocated by Amadio and colleagues  Again, this exercise is performed with the forearm supinated and wrist in neutral, resting on the tabletop. The exercise consists of passive flexion of the digits, followed by passive extension of the MP joints with the PIP and DIP joints flexed and the wrist in neutral to slight extension. Slow, gentle stretches are performed:<br /><br />Patient education: The patient must understand that a tight grip with or without weighted resistance greatly increases the risk of rupture during the early healing of flexor tendon repairs  The orthosis is removed for exercises only, not for ADLS, etc. NMES may be added to the therapy program once the patient has been performing active flexion exercises for 2-3 days. NMES is not recommended the first exercise session of the day: The dorsal blocking orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night. 6 Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking orthosis is discontinued. The AROM exercises described at 4 weeks are continued. Additional exercises timeframe include: initiated at this Passive PIP joint extension, with the MP joint slighlly flexed [no passive Gentle blocking exercises to the PIP joint wilh the MP joint extension to the DIP joint] partially flexed Gentle blocking to the DIP joint with both the MP and PIP joints partially the small finger][Note: Blocking is not performed the initial exercise flexed Ino blocking to session of the day:] 211<br /><br />
