A custom-fabricated extension orthosis is fitted positioning the PIP joint in full extension for coritinual wear. [Note: If the PIP J cannot be held in 0? of extension due to edema, include Ihe MP J arid DIP J &s needed to ensure full extension initially: ] AROM exercises are initiated to all digits except the PIPJ of the involved digil; Emphasis is placed on active and passive flexion of the involved digit DIP joint:<br /><br />10 - 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed: Within 48 hours following suture removal (assuming the incision site is healed) , scar mobilization techniques may be initiated. This may include scar massage with lotion, along with applying a scar pad to wear at night.<br /><br />Edema control consists of 1 CobanTM or fingersocks.<br /><br />The orthosis should include only the PIP joint. A separate orthosis, which includes the MP, PIP and DIP joints, may be worn for night wear when it is difficult to maintain full PIP joint extension in the digital orthosis.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop therapy appointment is valuable to assess the edema, scar, ROM of adjacent digits and ensure excellent PIPJ extension in the orthosis:<br /><br />4 Weeks Postop AROM exercises may be initiated to the PIP joint in a mid-range. This exercise is performed by stabilizing the MP joint in * 459 of flexion and focusing on active PIPJ extension to 09 and active flexion to approximately 609 . This may require an orthosis to stop/block the patient from flexing further. The orthosis can pre-position the MP joint and block the PIP J flexion or can be stabilized with the uninvolved hand and include only the digit. The limited arc of motion will gradually mobilize adhesions to gradually gain flexion while balancing the flexion with the extension: During the exercise, forceful active extension should be performed with light force to achieve active flexion. [Note: The goal is to gradually gain active flexion while maintaining excellent active extension:] Applying level elastic tape such Kinesio@ dorsum of the digit Roiv vexee fully extended, ingrigdai_ cnas nobilizenhe heeklo assists passive digital extension serves to mobilize with active exercises: This simple technique has proven valuable for these authors.<br /><br /> 5 Weeks Postop joint positioned in * 459 of flexion, the focus is on PIPJ active extension to 09, with active flexion of the PIP AROM exercises are progressed at the PIP joint level to increase the arc of motion: Again, with the MP joint to 759-909 Full arc AROM exercises are initiated with emphasis on isolated blocking to the PIP and DIP joint, and 6 Weeks Postop Exercises should be performed 4-6 times a day, 25 repetitions. active PIP joint extension, with the MP joint blocked in flexion (reverse blocking) . 150<br /><br />
