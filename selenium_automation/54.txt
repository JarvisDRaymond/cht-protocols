<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS FDP TENODESIS</h1>
INDICATIONS Ireparable FDP tendon injury (unable to achieve successful end-to-end repair) Tendon rupture Patient interested in limited postop recovery<br /><br />SURGERY The most common approach for a FDP tenodesis is performed by attaching the FDP remnant tendon into the middle phalanx The goal of the surgery is not to achieve AROM, but to prevent the DIP joint from collapsing into DIP joint hyperextension when grasping objects.<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed:<br /><br />light dressing is applied, consisting of 1 sterile gauze and 1" CobanTM or fingersocks.<br /><br />custom-fabricated dorsal blocking orthosis is fitted to the digit positioning the DIP joint in 309 of flexion for continual wear: If there is any tendency for the PIP joint to hyperextend, the PIP joint should be included in the orthosis, with the PIP joint in 309 of flexion, as well. An alternative to this PIP joint orthosis is custom-fabricating a figure-of-8 ring in flexion or fitting the patient with an Oval 8 or Murphy ring for the PIP joint(ensuring the pre-fabricated orthosis indeed prevents PIP joint hyperextension).<br /><br />Active and PROM in flexion, along with active extension (within the orthosis) is permitted 3-4 times & day, 25 slow repetitions. [Note: The orthosis for the DIP joint should remain on, as the tenodesis does not generate any active motion:]<br /><br />10 - 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed:<br /><br />Scar mobilization may be initiated once the suture line is completely healed. Scar massage with lotion is typically adequate for scar remodeling:<br /><br />Edema control consists of 1 CobanTM or fingersocks:<br /><br />The ROM exercises should emphasize full tendon gliding of the FDS, including PIPJ blocking:<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop If the PIP joint was included in the initial orthosis, re-evaluate the PIP joint for hyperextension and adjust the orthosis to include the DIP joint only, assuming hyperextension is not an issue.<br /><br />8 ~ 10 Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking gutter orthosis may be discontinued. Should the DIP joint tend to easily rest in 0? of extension, it is recommended to continue the orthosis 2-4 additional weeks.<br /><br />Hand strengthening may be initiated with putty or a hand exerciser. When using putty, the putty should be formed into a cylinder to ensure resistance to flexion is at the PIP joint and not the on the DIP joint, which could passively extend the DIP joint.<br /><br />224<br /><br />
