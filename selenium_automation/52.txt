<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS TRUE ACTIVE MOVEMENT PROGRAM SAINT JOHN REGIONAL HOSPITAL PROTOCOL [Therapy for Zone 1 and 2 Flexor Tendon Repair Using True Active Movement] [continued]</h1>
Orthosis:<br /><br />Patients continue to wear their orthosis at all times except hand hygiene and select exercises/daily living activities: Wound Care/Dressings: Patients are typically still using CobanTM at this time as their fingers swell while they actively break down scar adhesions during exercise/daily living activities. Patients are instructed to begin scar massage at this time. At least twice @ day for 5 minutes.<br /><br />29days 4 35 days (Fifth week post repair)<br /><br />Exercises/Daily living activities: Patients continue to work on full passive composite flexion of all fingers and active extension of each finger in the orthosis: Patients continue to work on gentle active tendon glide trying to achieve @ full fist position. Patients must continue to avoid forceful, jerking movements. Patients continue with active synergistic movement of the wrist and fingers. Patients continue to use every day light activities to help achieve active, tendon glide and finger dexterity:<br /><br />Splinting: If the DIP joint stops moving, the therapist and surgeon will Ultrasound the finger to ensure that there is no rupture and to verify if the tendon is simply stuck in scar: If an FDP tendon is adhered at this timeframe a relative motion extension orthosis is begun full-time to help promote active, differential glide This orthosis allows & patient to exercise while living: Patients will wear this orthosis while completing their prescribed exercises as well: Relative motion flexion orthoses can also be fabricated to help with extensor lags. Relative motion orthoses can avoid the need for tenolysis, which could create more scar and increased risk of rupture.<br /><br />36 days_-49 days (sixth-and seventh-week post repair)<br /><br />The Manchester short splint is discontinued at the 6-week mark: Patients continue with full range of motion exercises described above if full movement has not been achieved: Patients can start to incorporate their hand into regular activity, still avoiding forceful gripping and heaving lifting activities: Night extension orthoses are started in patients who have developed PIP joint flexion contractures:<br /><br />43 dax I Z0-dax mark Leighth_ninth_and tenth-week post repair)<br /><br />Start grip strengthening activities for the hand Continue with all exercises if full ROM has not been achieved Continue with night extension orthosis and/or relative motion flexion/ extension programs. If the patient has not already returned to work, discussions about return to work programs begin:<br /><br />Don't lose patiencel It may take 6 to 8 months for a patient to achieve full hand function:<br /><br />222<br /><br />
