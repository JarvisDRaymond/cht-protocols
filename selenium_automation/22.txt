Those exercises include: Mid-range aclive flexion and extension in a tenodesis movement pattern Short-arc to mid-range composite active flexion followed by forceful active extension Active extension with the wrist in neutral to slight extension Isolated active extension of the index and small fingers (i.e. EIP and EDQM) , particularly important with lacerations to the index and small AROM to the wrist Isolated EDC exercises with the IP joints flexed (IP Js may be taped to better isolate the MP Js) .<br /><br />The custom-fabricated forearm based extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night:<br /><br />NMES may be initiated to enhance tendon gliding through the dense adhesions.
