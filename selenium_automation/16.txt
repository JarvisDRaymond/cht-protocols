The extension orthosis is reduced to night wear only. 9 Weeks Postop Begin decreasing the frequency of the dynamic flexion orthosis, with @ goal to eliminate by 10-12 weeks postop. [Note: With an early active motion program; it is uncommon to require & dynamic flexion orthosis. When it is necessary though, gradually eliminating it is recommended:] 10 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis is discontinued s0 long as the extensor lag is <109  CONSIDERATIONS For older patients with arthritic PIP joints or those individuals who tend to form dense scars, it is well advised to progressively decrease the extension orthosis wearing time as early as the fifth week to avoid a residual limitation in passive flexion.<br /><br /> the PIP joint, with less force for active flexion: theAROiirexercises are initiated to the PIP joint, emphasis is placed on far greater effort to actively extend at Balance the flexion and extension exercises. The goal is to restore active flexion; while any extensor lag: preventing/limiting<br /><br />161<br /><br />
