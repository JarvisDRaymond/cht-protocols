<h1>Chapler 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS EXTENSOR CARPI ULNARIS (ECU) REPAIR</h1>
POSTOPERATIVE THERAPY 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed,<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed.<br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied to Ihe hand and forearm;<br /><br />A custom-fabricated static forearm based wrist immobilization orthosis is fitted in 209 of ertension and slight (10%) ulnar deviation to wear at all times.<br /><br />AROM exercises are initiated to the digits and thumb 2-3 times & day, 15 repetitions.<br /><br />10 - 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed.<br /><br /> Once the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion is initiated #3 times & day for 1-3 minutes. 3 Weeks Postop Gentle AROM exercises are initiated to the wrist in a mid-range arc of motion (flexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation). The goal is to gradually restore ROM over a 7-10 day period of time. Exercises are performed 3-4 times a day, 25 repetitions [Note: To position the forearm in supination maintains the ECU over the head of and along the length (midline) of the Ulna. Begin in this position and a week later transition to forearm neutral position and pronation to mobilize adhesions in various planes of motion:] Moist heat before exercise is recommended  The wrist immobilization orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night. 4 Weeks Postop Full arc AROM of the wrist may be initiated: The wrist immobilization orthosis may be left off for 3 one hour sessions during the day for light ADLs. 5 Weeks Postop Gentle, AAROM (self-passive) exercises may be initiated to the wrist. Begin with passive wrist flexion with the forearm supinated. This maintains the ECU in midline to the Ulna. The wrist immobilization orthosis may be left off for light ADLS during the day: It should be worn for protection othervise.<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop Passive wrist flexion may be added, including 1-2 pound weights for weighted wrist stretches. Be sure to perform PROM with the forearm in supination, neutral and pronalion:<br /><br />The wrist immobilization orthosis is discontinued, excepl for activities requiring weighted resistance > 5 pounds, repetitive motion, compression and/or dlistraction of Ihe wrist, sports, and riahual labor, 9 Weeks Postop The patient may return to most activilies, except those requlring excessive load dernands or repetition on the wrist and sports. Such activities may be delayed 12 weeks Or more_<br /><br />4oo<br /><br />
