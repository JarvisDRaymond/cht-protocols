<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS TRUE ACTIVE MOVEMENT PROGRAM</h1>
SAINT JOHN REGIONAL HOSPITAL PROTOCOL [Therapy for Zone and 2 Flexor Tendon Repalr Using True Actlve Movement] Lisa Flewelling; MScOT, BScOT Amanda Higgins, BScOT Why we_use Irue Aclive Movement wllh our Ilexor tendon repalrs: Eliminating any gap with full fist Ilexion and extension testing during wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) surgery gives Us Ihe confidence to Use true active movement; WALANT has taught us to avoid place and hold in @ full fist exercise, as this positioning does not promote a smooth gliding tendon and places the tendon in @ position of high load. ii ii iv<br /><br />Immediately after surqery The hand is placed in a slab with IP joints of all fingers in full extension, MCP joints in 30 degrees of flexion and wrist in comfortable extension. bulky, compression dressing is applied. Patients are taught to keep the hand elevated above the level of the heart all the time. No exercise is taught at this time, which allows the bleeding at the repair site to settle. Patients are instructed to get off all pain medication for their first therapy visit in 3-5 days so they can listen to their body and follow pain guided therapy by not doing what hurts.<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3-5 days post-surgery_but can be_up_to_lO days: Irue Active Movement begins<br /><br />Precautions: If the patient has an infection true active movement is not begun at this time and @ discussion is had with the patient'$ surgeon. Patients are taught what positions to avoid to protect the tendon repair: This includes full fist, full extension and any forceful use (i.e:: heavy gripping, tugging, torqueing or twisting) of the hand:<br /><br />Wound Care/Dressings: Patients are taught to safely remove the slab and dressing: Patients are taught to wash the wound with tap water and mild soap, without putting the hand and wrist in unsafe positions. Instructions are given to patients on how to dress the wound with a light layer of Vaseline and gauze dressing for their palm and Vaseline and CobanTM or other compression wrap for their fingers: Patients are instructed to complete daily hand hygiene and dressing changes: Patients do not remove their CobanTM to do their exercises.<br /><br />Orthosis: Patients are provided with a removable, dorsal block orthosis with IP joints of all fingers in full extension, MCP joints in 30 degrees of flexion and the wrist in comfortable extension.vi A discussion is had with our surgeons about whether to begin our protocol in a Manchester short splint. This orthosis allows the wrist to fully flex, but limits wrist extension to 45 degrees. Fingers are kept in the same position as described above.vii Patients are instructed to wear the dorsal block orthosis all the time, except when performing wound care and for certain exercises.<br /><br />Exercises: Our biggest priority is to keep the tendon moving so it doesn't get stuck in scar. Patients are taught three exercises to be completed hourly. Patients can complete their exercises in or out of the orthosis: this is a clinical decision made by the therapist, Exercise #I: Passive composite flexion exercises to all fingers. This exercise is Used as a I 'warm- Up" to take tension out of the joints. Each finger can be held for 30 seconds each hour, until full PROM is achieved with ease.<br /><br />220<br /><br />
