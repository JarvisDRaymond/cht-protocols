Should the patient demonstrate 2 75% of normal IP joint flexion, it is recommended to avoid blocking: Individuals that do not form dense scar tissue may not be forming enough dense, peritendinous adhesions to support the repair;, Thus, being somewhat protective of the repair (in the presence of excellent motion and negligible scar) is recommended.<br /><br />Passive extension may be initiated to the wrist and separately to the thumb (with the wrist slightly flexed): It is recommended to begin passive IP joint extension with the wrist and MP joint slightly flexed the initial 3-5 days. Subsequently, gentle composite passive extension may be performed:<br /><br />A custom fabricated wrist and thumb static orthosis (including the IP joint) in extension, may be initiated 2-3 times a day for 20 minutes or for night wear as necessary.<br /><br />Patient education is important; The patient should be instructed to avoid weighted resistance to the involved hand, along with avoiding activities requiring a tight, sustained pinch.
