The goal is to completely discontinue the orthosis between 16 and 18 weeks post immobilization:<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS Achieving full ROM following a chronic boutonniere deformity is quite difficult. To achieve 209 of PIP joint extension, 5" of DIP joint hyperextension and 90" of PIP joint flexion is an excellent outcome  Achieving excellent outcomes from surgical intervention for chronic boutonniere deformities are equally difficult:<br /><br />It is important to restore maximum passive PIP joint extension prior to immobilizing for 8 weeks. Custom- fabricated, hand-based, static-progressive orthoses (for passive PIP joint extension) are ideal until the contracture is resolved. From that point, begin the complete immobilization process for 8 weeks.<br /><br />156<br /><br />
