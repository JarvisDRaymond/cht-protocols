<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS EARLY MOTION ~ ZONES V & VI</h1>
INDICATIONS The early motion program for extensor tendon repairs is indicated for complex extensor tendon injuries in which the periosteum is violated or the soft tissue is extensively involved with Zone V or VI lacerations and repairs. Another indication for the early motion program is rigid fixation of any metacarpal fracture in the area of Zone V VI; with a concomitant extensor tendon injury.<br /><br />This therapy program is not necessary for simple lacerations. Typically, straight forward extensor tendon repairs have excellent results with a 4 week immobilization program prior to commencing active range of motion exercises.<br /><br />RATIONALE Le THERAPY PROGRAM The early motion program permits a minimum of 3-Smm of extensor tendon excursion, which is believed to be sufficient to prevent dense peritendinous adhesions from blocking tendon gliding. In all likelihood, without early motion the extensor tendons would become severely adherent to bone and subcutaneous tissue. In complement to this, the early motion favorably influences the orientation of the collagen fibers along the tendons:<br /><br />By permitting 308-358 of MP joint flexion, this helps minimize the likelihood of MP joint contractures by allowing the collateral ligaments some degree of tension:<br /><br />AROM decreases edema, maintains soft tissue elasticity and promotes healing: POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 - 5 Days Postop The bulky dressing is removed:<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed. Be sure to include circumferential edema measurements along the DPFC and dorsum of the hand:<br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied to the hand and forearm, along with fingersocks or 1 CobanTM<br /><br />custom-fabricated forearm based orthosis is fitted with the wrist positioned in 309 to 408 of extension. At the digital level, an outrigger is constructed using 2" wide Velcro@ slings with rubber band traction (supporting the PIP and DIP joints) to maintain the MP and IP joints in extension. The orthosis is worn continuously. Note: The slings should be of sufficient width to block both PIP and DIP joint flexion. If necessary, individual extension finger orthoses may be fitted in place of the slings. A custom-fabricated forearm based orthosis blocking flexion is fitted in a bivalve fashion to the outrigger. This orthosis should allow 308-358 of MP joint flexion to the digits.<br /><br />AROM exercises are initiated at the MP joint level within the rubber band traction: The patient attempts to simply flex the fingers to the volar base of the static forearm based resting pan orthosis This allows the patient to flex approximately 309- 358 at the MP joint. Through the dynamic rubber band traction, the MP joints are then brought back into neutral extension. The patient performs these exercises 15 repetitions, four times a day. [Patient Handout]<br /><br />Between exercise sessions and at night the patient is fitted with @ custom-fabricated forearm based extension orthosis with the wrist in 309-40* of extension and the MP joints in 09 of extension. The patient is cautioned to passively hold the wrist and digits in full extension while changing to the forearm based static extension orthosis.<br /><br />Active and PROM exercises are performed to the IP joints twice a day, 25 repetitions, while in the forearm based static extension orthosis. These exercises are performed once in the morning before applying the outrigger (which is worn during the day) and once later in the afternoon or evening:<br /><br />10 - 14 Days Postop Once the sutures are removed and the wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion, along with applying a scar pad (e.g; Otoform KTM, Rolyan 50/50TM or Rolyan@Ezemixo) may be initiated  In addition, scar retraction is performed. Scar massage with lotion is encouraged 3-4 times a day:<br /><br />166<br /><br />
