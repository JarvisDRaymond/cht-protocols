Hyperexlonsion of the DIP joint occurs due fo tension on the Iatercsl bark<br /><br />NON-SURGICAL MANAGEMENT [Acute Injury] THERAPY 0 - 6 Weeks An initial evalualion is performed.<br /><br />Edema control Is initiated as necessary Utilizing CobanTM , fingersocks or Digislee /e5. A custom-fabricated volarly based extension orthosis is fitted to the PIP joint in full e/tension, #/ t DIP joint lefl free for ROM: The orthosis is worn continuously. Note: A dorsal orthosis ra/ be fabricatedin conjunction with the volar orthosis to help maintain full PIP joint ertension: In addition, &5 tre acute edema has subsided, @ serial cast may be considered to maximize ezcellent irrrobilzation and positioning of the PIP joint in neutral: Active and PROM exercises are initiated to all joints of the hand viith the erception of tre PIP jcint of te involved digit, The key exercise for the involved digit is both active and passive flefion to tre DIP joint. Tris will place the oblique retinacular ligament on stretch and limit lateral band adherence and volar subluxation:<br /><br />2 - 3 Weeks Post Immobilization The orthosis is reassessed for fit, comfort and pressure areas.<br /><br />6 Weeks Post Immobilization Light, short arc active flexion (t 50% of full motion), and unrestricted active & passive ertension ezercise; cre initiated to the PIP joint of the involved digit 4 times a day; 25 repetitions  Ernphasis is placed on tne re /erse blocking exercise to maximize PIP joint extension, along with isolated blocking to the PIP joint and DIP joint vitn the MP joint extended:<br /><br />The PIP joint extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night. The orthosis should be carefully evaluated to ensure it is immobilizing the PIP joint in full extension.<br /><br />7 Weeks Post Immobilization Ezercise sessions are increased to each two hours. Forceful active extension is encouraged along vith light active flezion. The goal is to steadily increase active flexion while maintaining full active extension: Isolated PROM erercises may be initiated to the PIP joint with the MP joint in extension. Should a PIP joint ertensor lag < 10" develop, the passive flexion should be avoided,<br /><br />The ertension orthosis isreroved three tirnes & day for one hour sessions for light ADLs. To decrease the wearing tire one hour each 2-3 days should result in discontinuing the orthosis during the day by 9 weeks;<br /><br />8 Week: Post Irnmobllizatlon Dorsal taping rray be Inltiated 2-3 tirnos & day for 20 mlnute sosslons, when Iimlted passive Ilexion is present;<br /><br />custorn fabricaled dynaric orthosis ray bo fabricatod; The proferred posilionlng Is wilh the MP joint in extension and Ihe dyraric Iraclion specilic to rioblllzing Iho PIP joinl, Tho dynamic orthosis is worn 3 - 4 tires & day for 220 minule sosslons,<br /><br />154<br /><br />
