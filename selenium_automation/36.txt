<h1>Chapler 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS</h1>
EXTENSOR POLLICIS DREVIS [EPB] OR ABDUCTOR POLLICIS LONGUS [APL] REPAIR<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 -5 days Postop The bulky compressive clressing Is removed <br /><br />An inilial evalualion Is performed,<br /><br />An olaslic stockinelte Is applied lo Ihe hand and forearm, dlong wilh 1 CobanTM or fingersock for the Ihumb;<br /><br />A custom fabricaled wrisl and Ihumb stalic orlhosis Is lilted wilh Ihe wrist in 209 of extension and the thumb midway belween palmar and radlial abduclion: The IP joint is left out of the orthosis as the inserlion of Ihe tendon(s) is proximal to Ihe IP joint; 10 - 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed,<br /><br />Once Ihe wound is completely healed, scar massage with lotion may be initiated:<br /><br />Manual desensitization exercises are iniliated 3-4 times & day. [Patient Handout] It is not uncommon for Ihe patient to report some degree of hypersensitivity near the area of the superficial branch of the radial nerve.<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop Genlle AROM may be initiated to the wrist while allowing the thumb to rest in a relaxed position. To exercise the wrist 3-4 times & day, 25 repetitions.<br /><br />Moist heat for 5 minutes prior to exercise enhances the flexibility of the joints and soft tissue structures. 4 Weeks Postop AROM exercises may be initiated to the wrist and separately to the thumb 4-6 times a day, 25 repetilions., Exercises for the thumb include: flexion, extension, abduction and adduction and circumduction:<br /><br />Ultrasound may be added to enhance scar suppleness and tendon gliding: 5 Weeks Postop With the AROM exercises, add composite active wrist and thumb flexion, wrist Ulnar deviation with thumb flexion and thumb adduction with simultaneous wrist extension to address extrinsic tightness of each tendon:<br /><br />The wrist and thumb static orthosis may be reduced to hand-based. 6 Weeks Postop AAROM exercises may be initiated to the wrist and separately to the thumb. The thumb orthosis may be left off during the day while performing light ADLs. 7 Weeks Postop With PROM exercises, add composite wrist and thumb flexion; wrist Ulnar deviation and thumb adduction with simultaneous wrist extension to address with thumb flexion extrinsic tightness of each tendon. Heat before 15 second stretches is recommended, The thumb orthosis is discontinued,<br /><br />8 Weeks Postop Hand and wrist strengthening may gradually be added, Delay sports and heavy lifting until 12 weeks. CONSIDERATIONS Patients tend to recover ROM quickly from EPB andlor APL lacerations and repairs. Typically, patients are placed on a home therapy program; with a small number of therapy visits. 181<br /><br />
