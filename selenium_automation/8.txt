Be sure removing the orthosis does not increase the extensor lag:<br /><br />8 Weeks Postop Composite PROM exercises may be initiated to the digit, assuming the extensor lag is less than 10".<br /><br />Continue to reduce the wearing time in the extension orthosis 1-2 hours each day. This should effectively discontinue the orthosis within one week.<br /><br />Putty or & hand exerciser with rubber band traction may be initiated. 10 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis may be worn every other night. The goal is to discontinue the orthosis by 12 weeks postop.<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS For older patients with arthritic PIP joints or those individuals who tend to form dense scars, it is well advised to progressively decrease the orthosis wearing time as early as the fifth week to avoid & residual limitation in passive flexion.<br /><br /> the PIP joint, with less force for active flexion: AsAROM exercises are initiated to the PIP joint, emphasis is placed on far greater effort to actively extend at<br /><br />153<br /><br />1<br /><br />
