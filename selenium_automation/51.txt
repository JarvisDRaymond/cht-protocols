<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS TRUE ACTIVE MOVEMENT PROGRAM SAINT JOHN REGIONAL HOSPITAL PROTOCOL [Therapy for Zone I and 2 Flexor Tendon Repair Using True Active Movement] [continued]</h1>
Exercises: [continued] Exercise #2: Active tendon glide of all the fingers Up to a half fist position or & modified tuck position . The aim is to have flexion of the DIP and PIP joints while the MCP joints maintain & 30 degree flexed position (similar to our orthosis positioning): We do not want & full fist position This movement should be gentle, pain free, and without forceful pulling or force on the repaired tendon: This is our most important exercise. Exercise #3: Active IPJ extension with the MCPJ held in flexion. Keeping the MCP jointin & flexed position will help to encourage full PIP joint extension. If this exercise is taught within splint, patients can be encouraged to touch to the roof of the orthosis. If this is taught early enough; PIP joint flexion contractures can be avoided: Exercises 2 & 3 can be done 10 times every hour patients are awake during the day: Patients actively hold each repetition for 10 seconds. This should not be forceful or painful: 41 days 14days (second week post repair)<br /><br />Wound Care/Dressings: Sutures are removed by the therapist. Patients are instructed to continue with edema management using CobanTM or compression wrap until there is no more swelling: Orthosis: At two weeks, the dorsal block orthosis is changed to a Manchester short splint if patients did not begin their protocol in this orthosis<br /><br />Exercises/Daily living activities: Patients continue to work on the 3 exercises from their first therapy visit on an hourly basis: PROM composite fist for each finger, AROM now up to 3/4th of a pain-free "fist" (or modified IP tuck) and AROM IPJ extension with MPJ flexion of the affected finger. A new exercise is introduced involving active synergistic movement of the wrist and fingers. With the Manchester short splint on or off, patients are taught to flex their wrist while extending their fingers, hold for 5 second count, and then extend wrist (Up until the block) while curling fingers into a tuck position. This exercise is done in a smooth , controlled and gentle fashion and can also be completed on an hourly basis. If the repair involves only the ring or small finger, patients are taught how they can remove their index finger from the protective straps of the Manchester Short Splint to allow them to use their thumb and index finger to start light; pain-free activities (i.e:: zippering winter jackets, opening a purse or book bag and pulling up pants):<br /><br />15 days  4 28 days (third and fourth week post repair)<br /><br />Exercises/Daily living activities: Patients are shown daily living activities that help to achieve active differential tendon glide. Patients can remove their orthosis to start trying to bend their fingers around their cell phone, try to spin @ water or wine glass on & table surface and/or try to crumple & tissue or towel on a table surface. These activities incorporate gentle, controlled IP tuck with some MCP flexion. These ideas are credited to Gwen van Strein (hand therapist in the Netherlands). Patients continue with their 3 main exercises and synergistic wrist AROM with a focus on obtaining a pain-free, full, active fist. If patients have a flexor lag at this time, secondary to scar adhesions, cinicaljudgement to adjust the frequency of their pafientaehercoe; Greocpiets Con use ther or of their Remember the purpose is to "keep the tendon moving" therapy visits.<br /><br />221<br /><br />
