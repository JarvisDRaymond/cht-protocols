<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONE V INDIANA EARLY PASSIVE MOTION PROGRAM [continued]</h1>
CONSIDERATIONS [continued]<br /><br />Concomitant median ond/or ulnar nerve repairs at the wrist require special consideration: Iftre rerves have been repaired, the wrist is initially placed in 10?-208 of extension. Increase extension 10? & week (from weeks 4 to 6] to gradually mobilize the nerve and subsequently limit extrinsic tighiness Iiine uincr nerve has been repaired, it is important to block the MP joints of the ring and small finger from hyperextension secondary to the lack of intrinsic function and clawing when the corsal blocking orthoss is discontinued. In addition, should the median nerve have been repaired, a night web spacer orthoss is recommended to avoid @ potential web space contracture secondary tO the denervation of the thenar muscles: If both nerves are repaired, the MP block should include all digits   [Note: These authors have been successful in limiting/preventing clawing by allowing some degree of residual EFT . Great effort is made to avoid passive MPJ extension beyond 308_450 throughout the course of therapy: It is not always effective, but has been favorably effective in # 10% of patients ] It is important to emphasize scar management. It is not uncommon for the flexor tendons to become somewhat adherent to the skin and subcutaneous tissues  Performing scar retraction by securing & piece of DycemTM just proximal to the repair site can be effective as the patient attempts to both flex and/or extend the digits.<br /><br />Patient education is critical for nerve injuries  The digits will be insensate for & number of months. The patient must keep the hand in their visual field and they must be sure the hand does not get close t0 extremes of temperature or sharp objects:<br /><br />Cold intolerance is common the first year following the injury: Wearing mittens versus gloves and applying the mittens before going into the cold is recommended. Keeping an extra pair of gloves in the car is recommended, in case there are car troubles and there is & need to walk in the extreme cold. Itis not uncommon for the patient to continue to regain active flexion and strength for 6-9 months or more following the repairs:<br /><br />236<br /><br />
