<h1>Chapter 21: FLEXOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES to IV EARLY ACTIVE MOBILIZATION (INDIANA PROGRAM) (conllnued]</h1>
6 Weeks Postop [contlnued] If active/passive extension is limiled, @ hand based exlension orlhosls may be worn eilher # 3 limes & day for 20-30 minutes or af night, Greal ccre musl be taken to ensure Ihe passive stretch is specific to the PIP joint and not forcing Ihe DIP joinl Inlo full exlenslon or hyperexlension; It is recommended to position the MP joint in + 30" (lexion and nol full exlension. Il Is Important to minimize wearing an extension orthosis during the day; in ordler to maximize aclive tendon glding; Buddy taping is iniliated belween Ihe involved dligil and an adjacent dligll , This is done simply to remind the patient not to use Ihe hand wilh any Iype of light grasp or weighted resistance to the hand. The hand may be used with light ADLs. [Note: Moleskin may be added to the buddy tape to help separate the digit from the adjacent digit, to prevent trapping belween fingers:]<br /><br />7 Weeks Postop A custom-fabricated dynamic or static-progressive extension orthosis is fabricated for PIP joint contractures 2 259, The MP joint is positioned in * 45" flexion, with the dynamic traction mobilizing the PIP joint. For joint contractures 4 250 pre-fabricated extension orthosis such as a safety pin splint, LMB or reverse knuckle bender are considerations:<br /><br />8 Weeks Postop Gentle, progressive resistance may be initiated beginning with a cylindrical foam ball, putty formed into a cylinder and finally a hand exerciser  This is @ progressive upgrade in resistance over a 10-14 day period. The purpose is to assist with gaining composite flexion.<br /><br />10 ~ 12 Weeks Postop The patient is encouraged to resume normal use of the hand in all ADL activities and to refrain from any activity with a tight, sustained grasp, tight grasp against resistance and lifting 2 15 pounds bilaterally.<br /><br />14 - 16 Weeks Postop Progressively increasing weighted resistance is permitted up to t 25 pounds bilaterally:<br /><br />16 4 20 Weeks Postop Sports with a tight, sustained grip against resistance (e.g. baseball, tennis, golf, lacrosse, hockey) and heavy lifting may be resumed, at the judgment of the surgeon and/or therapist.<br /><br />Gradually increasing the practice and playing schedule an additional month is encouraged for the avid and elite athlete.<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS Therapy visits should be scheduled in the range of two times a week from 2 to 5 weeks postop. As the early active motion program is initiated, if edema is significant (> 7mm the uninjured opposite hand digit) it is recommended to delay the early motion program. The edema may add significant resistance to the flexor tendons and risk rupture. The best results are achieved when the edema is brought under control during the initial 7-10 days following surgery. Placing the patient back into a bulky compressive dressing an additional 2-3 days is preferred over applying a basic gauze dressing and 1" Coban: The efficient reduction in edema over the additional 2-3 days will allow the rehab program to begin effectively.<br /><br />The first exercise session of the day is PROM only with the Indiana Modified Duran exercises.<br /><br />Itis particularly valuable when the patient can achieve > 50% of active flexion within the initial two to three weeks postop. To have therapy visits 2-3 times a week Ihe initial 3 weeks following surgery is extremely valuable for ensuring oplimal AROM and a successful outcome. Recognize that all individuals heal at different rates; Tendon repairs are the one key area where the therapy program must be managed and modified based on Ihe clnical judgment of the therapist: The home program will need to be adjusted and advanced as much as @ week wilh the individual that forms dense scar and is slow to recover molion, and backed down by roughly @ week when there is minimal scarring and particularly excellent AROM early. In combinalion wilh these considerations, it is vital to have & clear understanding of any previous or current medical history that may influence the quality of tendon healing and the course of postop therapy.<br /><br />216<br /><br />
