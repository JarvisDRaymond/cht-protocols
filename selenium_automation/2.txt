Exercise sessions may be increased to 6 times a day: 10 Weeks Post Immobilization Add composite passive flexion of the digit if necessary. The mallet finger orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night: 11 Weeks Post Immobilization The orthosis is left off 2-3 one hour sessions & day for light ADLs. [Carefully monitor for an extensor lag] 12 Weeks Post Immobilization The orthosis is left off 4-6 one hour sessions & day for light ADLs.
