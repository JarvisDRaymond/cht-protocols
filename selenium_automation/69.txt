With severe orthosis one hour every day EFT it may be necessary to delay weaning out of the orthosis. The patient may return to unrestricted use of the hand in daily activity: The therapist or surgeon guides the patient with activities demanding high levels of weight or tight sustained grasp against a counter- force (e.g: work tasks, sports) .<br /><br />4 - 6 Months Postop Returning to physically demanding jobs and sports requiring a tight grasp against a counterforce is delayed until this time frame.<br /><br />CONSIDERATIONS If the patient is having difficulty recapturing active flexion, it is important to carefully monitor range of motion and encourage frequent therapy appointments in order to maximize flexion. The 3 to 7 week time frame is critical for recovering full tendon excursion:<br /><br />Concomitant median and/or Ulnar nerve repairs at the wrist require special consideration: If the nerves have been repaired, the wrist is initially placed in neutral and gradually increased 159 of extension beginning at 3 weeks. If the Ulnar nerve has been repaired, it is important to block the MP joints of the ring and small finger from hyperextension and secondary clawing when the dorsal blocking orthosis is discontinued: For combined median and ulnar nerve repairs, the MP block includes all four digits to prevent clawing and stretching out the MP joint volar plates: In addition, should the median nerve have been repaired, a night web spacer orthosis may be fabricated and fitted.<br /><br />It is important to emphasize scar management. Itis not uncommon for the flexor tendons to become somewhat adherent to the skin and subcutaneous tissues Performing scar retraction by securing a piece of DycemTM just proximal to the repair site can be effective as the patient attempts to both flex and/or extend the digits. The patients report the technique to be uncomfortable, but effective. Patient education is critical with nerve injuries The digits will be insensate and lack motor function in the individual nerve distribution for months. The patient must ensure the digits are kept in their and they must be sure the hand does not get close to extremes of visual field temperature or sharp objects Itis important to monitor for motor return (i.e monthly testing of the median nerve intrinsic muscles). NMES is a valuable testing tool to isolate and test individual and ulnar nerve to manual muscle testing: muscles, in complement<br /><br />Itis common for the patient to continue to regain active flexion, hand continue to recover for 6-9 months or more following the repairs. strength and the nerve(s)<br /><br />239<br /><br />
