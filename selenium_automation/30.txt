It is equally Important to monitor for an extensor and to rebalance Ihe exercise program accordingly. The goal is to achieve lag each of these stages of passive flexion within 5-7 days. A custom-fabricated dynamic or static-progressive orthosis may be fabricated to maximize and restore full wrist flexion; The orthosis is worn 3-4 times & day for 20-30 minute sessions. The hand based extension orthosis may be left off for 3 one hour sessions during the day for light ADLs.<br /><br />The extension orthosis is continued belween exercise sessions and at night. If the extensor lag is minimal (s 159), leave the orthosis off for 4-5 one hour sessions during the day for light activity. 6 Weeks Postop Exercises should continue to prioritize the extrinsic extensor tightness. This includes composite passive flexion of the wrist and digits.<br /><br /> A custom-fabricated dynamic or static-progressive flexion orthosis may be fitted (wrist slight flexion and composite dynamic flexion to the digits) to resolve EET , worn 4-6 times a day When EET is significant, the orthosis should be for 20-30 minute sessions. extensor The extension orthosis mav be left off 6 one hour sessions during the day for light activity, assuming the lag is minimal(s1 59). Putty and a hand exerciser with rubber band traction may be added to maximize active flexion: Isolated EDC exercises against soft putty may be initiated to facilitate MPJ extension: 8 Weeks Postop The patient may return to all activities, with the exception of activities requiring a tight grasp. The extension orthosis is worn at night only. By 9 weeks reduce the wearing time to every other night. 10 Weeks Postop The ertension orthosis is discontinued, CONSIDERATIONS Early, aclive mid-range of motion for the wrist can be extremely beneficial for limiting EET ultimately.
