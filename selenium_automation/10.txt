The initial orthosis must ensure excellent extension at the PIP joint by maintaining 0" of extension.<br /><br />Once ROM exercises are initiated, gradually increase the arc of active flexion and the exercise sessions in order to minimize an extensor lag: It is extremely difficult to recapture PIP joint extension. Exercises to emphasize include: beginning with short-arc to mid-arc active flexion, performing passive DIP joint flexion and extension with the PIP joint at 09 and blocking the MP joint in flexion while attempting PIP joint extension:<br /><br />[Chronic Injury: > 3 weeks from initial injury] An initial evaluation is performed .  Carefully document the current passive and active digital motion: Typically; a fairly notable PIP joint flexion contracture is present (30* or more) and often the DIP joinf hyperextends and is not passively supple in flexion: Initially; the PIP joint flexion contracture must be resolved. This requires a custom-fabricated dynamic, static progressive or serial static orthosis to resolve the joint contracture. For notable joint contractures (2 309) & static progressive PIP joint extension orthosis is fitted and worn multiple sessions 6 times for 30 minute sessions). during the day (+ Once the PIP joint contracture is reduced to 109-159 , may respond to & pre-manufactured safety pin splint or & reverse knuckle bender.
