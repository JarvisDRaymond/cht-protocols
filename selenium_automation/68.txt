Note: If there is an associated nerve the wrist level (which typical), are continued within the restraints of the dorsal blocking orthosis. Midrange AROM exercises are performed to the wrist, along with full arc motion to the digits. [Emphasis is placed on gradually increasing the effort/active force for flexion, while gently performing active extension.  The goal is to gradually elongate the adhesions and not directly "break" adhesions ] The hook-fist exercise (both place and hold and actively) is a valuable exercise to add once out of the DBO for exercise. 5 Weeks Postop Adjust the DBO to 450 of wrist extension: Gentle blocking may be initiated to the PIP and DIP joints with the proximal joints in slight flexion. 6 Weeks Postop The dorsal blocking orthosis is discontinued, except when in busy public settings or needing to lift a weighted object: Unrestricted active and AAROM exercises are emphasized  Exercises emphasizing differential tendon gliding of the FDS and FDP are encouraged: Passive extension of the wrist and digits is initiated. Itis recommended to gradually mobilize the wrist in extension (heat & stretch, holding the end range 10-15 seconds per stretch and not aggressively forcing the motion) & separately passively extend the digits with the wrist in neutral or slight flexion initially (gradually mobilizing adhesions) the initial 3-5 days. Subsequently, attention is placed directly on the EFT, To independently mobilize the wrist and separately the digits for & short period of time prior to focusing on the EFT has proven effective and efficient in resolving the EFT and maximizing tendon excursion. A custom-fabricated wrist and MP joint blocking orthosis is fabricated with the wrist in extension to isolate the FDS and FDP and enhance tendon gliding: Each visit the MPJs are positioned in increased flexion to ensure tendon gliding as the MPJs progressively flexed and not just with the MP Js in full extension.<br /><br />custom-fabricated forearm based extension orthosis or @ forearm based dynamic extension orthosis (blocking the MPJs in slight flexion) may be initiated if extrinsic flexor tightness is significant. Note: It is Common to require some form of static, static progressive or dynamic orthotic to resolve the extrinsic flexor tightness. When the extrinsic tightness is severe (L.e. cannot achieve composite passive extension of the wrist to at least 309 with the digits fully extended the orthosis should be worn between exercise sessions and possibly at night to remedy the EFT in a relatively short period of time (.e. + 3 weeks).<br /><br />238<br /><br />
