<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON INJURIES Zones IV-VII EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS Relative Motion Extension Approach (1,2) Early Active Motion F Author: Julianne W Howell; PT, MS, CHT</h1>
U INDICATIONS Primary or delayed surgically repaired extensor tendons of the fingers in zones IV-VII Single or multiple tendons (at least one common or independent extensor must be intact) Sharp or ragged mechanism of injury Compatible to use with associated injuries/repairs such as: digital nerve repair; digital vessel repair; MCP joint capsule, collateral ligament, stable metacarpal or proximal phalangeal fractures CONTRAINDICATIONS When all EDC, EIP and EDM tendons are involved. [Note: Recommendation use static WHFO or HFO MCP joints in 30-400 flexion, IPs free] POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION with Relative Motion Extension (RME) 1 3 -5 Days Postop Remove the bulky compressive dressing [Note: It is strongly preferred to begin therapy during this time frame as the outcomes are superior, as documented in the literature:] An initial evaluation is performed. Control edema with a light compressive dressing on the hand/wrist and CobanTM finger sleeves as needed. Use the chart below to determine the orthosis(es) to fabricate. To protect the repair while fabricating the orthosis, position the repaired digit(s) MCP joint(s) in 159-209 more relative extension than the adjacent MCP joints with a tongue depressor or pencil. Separately, keep the wrist in & neutral position.
