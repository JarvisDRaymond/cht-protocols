Otherwise, & custom-fabricatod orthosis irnrrobiliziri trio DIP joint may be fabricated for terminal tendon repairs, where the pin is nof erposed. Active ROM exercises are initiated to the MP and PIP joints 3 times & day, 15-25 repotitions  Ernphasis i place on light, active Use of the hand versus specific exercises.<br /><br />10 5 14 Days Postop Any sutures are removed. Scar massage with lotion may be initiated once the incision site is corngietel / healed.<br /><br />The patient remains on a home therapy program:<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop The pin is removed:<br /><br />Mid-range active flexion, with full range active extension exercises are initiated 3-4 times & day,25 repetitions: Emphasis is placed on forceful active extension and light force for active flezion. The goal is to gradually recapture flexion while maintaining full active extension. [Patient Handout] Should the PIPJ tend to hyperextend, it is positioned in slight flexion with attempts at active DIP joint ertension. This may require a pre-fabricated or custom-fabricated static orthosis to block hyperertension.<br /><br />A custom-fabricated finger orthosis in extension (e.g: mallet orthosis) is fitted to wear between ezercise sessions and at night in place of the tip protector. Typically, the tip protector can be heated and rernolded to serve this purpose:<br /><br />7 Weeks Postop Full-range AROM exercise may be initiated and increased to 6 times a day.<br /><br />8 Weeks Postop The rallet orthosis is reroved for 3 one hour sessions during the day.<br /><br />Gentle, self-passive flezion ray be initiated to the DIP joint.<br /><br />9 Weeks Postop The finger orthosis is rerroved for an hour 4-6 times & day:<br /><br />10 Weeks Postop The mallet orthosis is worn at night only, assuming a negligible extensor lag (.e. 510%). Should passive DIP joint flexion be less than 459, consider adding a stalic progressive or dynamic flexion orthosis cornbined for the PIP and DIP joint. The orthosis may be worn 3-4 times a day for 20 minute sessions; Again, this is based on clinical judgment. Should the extensor lag be 2 15", this could risk increasing the lag:<br /><br />148<br /><br />
