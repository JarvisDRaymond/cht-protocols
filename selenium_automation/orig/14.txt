<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES V & VI - Delayed Motion [continued]</h1>
Weeks Postop [continued] Ultrasound may be initiated as & means of heat to facilitate tendon gliding and minimize scar adherence. This is one indication where Ultrasound is valuable, from @ clinical perspective.<br /><br />Moist heat before exercise sessions is beneficial for enhancing mobility and comfort with exercise <br /><br />Kinesio@ Taping to the dorsum of the hand may assist with reducing dorsal hand edema and effect localized areas of scar adherence_<br /><br />The forearm based extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night: The orthosis may be left off for 1-2 one hour sessions for light ADLs.<br /><br />5 Weeks Postop Exercises to add: combined active flexion of the wrist and digits (to begin addressing extrinsic extensor tightness) , isolated PROM to the wrist, and emphasize the active hook-fist exercise.<br /><br />6 Weeks Postop PROM exercises may be initiated to the hand. Initially, emphasis is placed on isolated passive flexion to the MP and PIP joints with the wrist extended. Once this is easily accomplished, it becomes important to add passive flexion of the MP and PIP joints with the wrist extended: So long as an extensor lag is not a concern, the final exercise to add is composite passive wrist flexion with digital flexion.<br /><br />The extension orthosis is continued between exercise sessions and at night: If the extensor lag is minimal (< 109), leave the orthosis off for 3-4 one hour sessions during the day for light activity.<br /><br />7 Weeks Postop Exercises should address any residual extrinsic extensor tightness.<br /><br />Composite taping may be initiated 3-4 times a day for 20 minute sessions  This may eliminate the need for @ custom-fabricated dynamic flexion orthosis. Once taped, active and passive wrist motion may be performed:<br /><br />( extensor The extension lag Ts orinisiaE minimal(<10?) . may be left off 5-6 one hour sessions during the day for light activity, assuming the Putty andlor a hand exerciser with rubber band traction may be added to maximize active flexion: Isolated EDC exercises against putty or isometric EDC exercises may be initiated to facilitate MP joint 8 Weeks Postop extension: The extension orthosis is worn * 3 times a day for one hour sessions and then at night. against resistance or sports. The patient may return to all activities, with the exception of those activities requiring & tight grasp The extension orthosis is worn at night only. 9 Weeks Postop The extension orthosis is worn every other night. 10 Weeks Postop The patient may return to all ADLs. Sports and activities demanding a power grip are delayed until 12 16 weeks postop. The extension orthosis is discontinued, 11 Weeks Postop CONSIDERATIONS a few days andlor prioritize forceful active extension to gradually resolve the notable extensor When MP joint extensor lags are greater than 209 it is recommended to reduce the exercise sessions for addition, NMES can be effective for improving extensor tendon gliding: lag: In 164<br /><br />
