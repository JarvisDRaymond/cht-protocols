<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIR ZONE IlI F CENTRAL SLIP REPAIR Delayed Motion</h1>
INDICATIONS Lacerations to the central slip, lateral bands and/or triangular ligament Avulsion of the central slip insertion off the middle phalanx Rupture of the central slip in association with a PIP joint volar dislocation<br /><br />POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 _ 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed.<br /><br />An elastic stockinette is applied to the hand and forearm, along with digital level edema control consisting of " sterile gauze and Coban" TM or fingersocks.<br /><br />A custom-fabricated extension orthosis is fitted positioning the PIP joint in full extension for continual wear. [Note: If the PIPJ cannot be held in 09 of extension due to edema, include the MPJ and DIPJ as needed to ensure full extension on aitdous AROM exercises are initiated all digits except the PIPJ of the involved digit. Emphasis is placed on active and passive flexion of the involved digit DIP joint:<br /><br />|L 10 5 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed. Within 48 hours following suture removal (assuming the incision site is healed) , scar mobilization techniques may be initiated: This may include scar massage with lotion, along with applying a scar pad to wear at night: Edema control consists of 1 CobanTM or fingersocks. The orthosis should include only the PIP joint: A separate orthosis, which includes the MP, PIP and DIP joints, may be worn for night wear when it is difficult to maintain full PIP joint extension in the digital orthosis. 3 Weeks Postop therapy appointment is valuable to assess the edema, scar, ROM of adjacent digits and ensure excellent PIP J extension in the orthosis Weeks Postop AROM exercises may be initiated to the PIP joint in a mid-range. This exercise is performed by stabilizing the MP joint in t 458 of flexion and focusing on active PIPJ extension to 09 and active flexion to approximately 609. This may require an orthosis to stop/block the patient from flexing further. The orthosis can pre-position the MP joint and block the PIP flexion or can be stabilized with the uninvolved hand and include only the digit.' The limited arc of motion will gradually mobilize adhesions to gradually gain flexion while balancing the flexion with the extension: During the exercise, forceful active extension should be performed with light force to achieve active flexion. [Note: The goal is to gradually gain active flexion while maintaining excellent active extension ] Applying digital level elastic tape such as Kinesio@ Tape on the dorsum of the digit while fully extended, assists with passive digital extension and serves to mobilize the skin with active ROM exercises  This simple technique has proven valuable for these authors 5 Weeks Postop AROM exercises are progressed at the PIP joint level to increase the arc of motion: Again, with the MP joint positioned in * 459 of flexion, the focus is on PIPJ active extension to 09, with active flexion of the PIP joint to 759-909 . E 6 Weeks Postop Full arc AROM exercises are initiated with emphasis on isolated blocking to the PIP and DIP joint, and active PIP joint extension, with the MP joint blockedin flexion (reverse blocking): Exercises should be performed 4-6 times a day, 25 repetitions. 150<br /><br />
