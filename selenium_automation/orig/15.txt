<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES V & VI _ F Delayed Motion [continued]</h1>
Considerations [continued] Itis critical to re-evaluate range of motion with each therapy appointment in order to ensure the patient is regaining flexion; while maintaining excellent extension: The range of motion measurements provides vital information for maintaining @ well-balanced therapy program: The therapy exercises are intended to gradually mobilize and elongate adhesions to permit steady gains in active flexion, while simultaneously maintaining excellent active extension. Transitioning from short-arc to mid-range to full-range motion is highly encouraged. With negligible extensor lags, permit greater time frames where the orthosis is not worn, to perform light activities.  This will help achieve and/or maintain quality tendon gliding and facilitate recovery: Weeks 3-6 are particularly critical time frames for therapy visits to adjust the therapy program and orthoses, based on gains/losses in motion.<br /><br />L<br /><br />
