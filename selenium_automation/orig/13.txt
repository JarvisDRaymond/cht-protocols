<h1>Chapter 17: EXTENSOR TENDON REPAIRS ZONES V & VI = 7 Delayed Motion</h1>
POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION 3 ~_ 5 Days Postop The bulky compressive dressing is removed.<br /><br />An initial evaluation is performed:<br /><br />light compressive dressing is applied to the hand and forearm, along with digital level edema control consisting of fingersocks or 1 Cobantm<br /><br />A custom-fabricated forearm based extension orthosis is fitted with the wrist in slight extension (+159) and the entire digit or digits in full extension. The orthosis is worn at all times. With the early postop edema and the compressive dressing; it is difficult to achieve and maintain full MP joint extension, which risks & slight or persistent extensor lag: ThUs, immobilizing the entire digit(s) the initial 10-14 days is quite helpful in properly maintaining the MP joints in full extension: [Note: With EIP repairs to the index only or an EDC repair of the index and/or middle finger - ~ immobilize the index and middle fingers: With EDC repairs to ring and/or small or EDQM repairs, immobilize the ring and small fingers. With multi-digit EDC repairs, immobilize all digits ]<br /><br />10 T 14 Days Postop The sutures are removed:. Once the incision site is healed, scar mobilization techniques may be initiated. This includes: scar massage with lotion, along with a scar remodeling product such as Otoform KTM, Or Rolyan@ 50/50TM. The scar pad is worn at night. [Note: The scar massage with lotion should be emphasized at this early stage and encouraged 3-4 times a day during early scar remodeling:]<br /><br />The light compressive dressing is replaced with an elastic stockinette and/or an edema glove. Persistent edema on the dorsum of the hand is not uncommon.<br /><br />Once the compressive dressing is transitioned to an elastic stockinette, the custom-fabricated extension orthosis may be adjusted to include the MP joints only. [Note: In the presence of multi-digit EDC repairs, having two orthoses; one which immobilizes the entire digit(s) to wear at night and a second custom orthosis which include the wrist and MP joints only for day wear:]<br /><br />3 Weeks Postop While wearing the extension orthosis that blocks the MP joints only, the straps along the dorsum of the MPJs may be removed to begin active extension from the resting position of extension. This will allow the EDC to begin contracting and begin gliding the tendon: [Note: Following the exercise, the strap is reapplied:] In addition, the orthosis may be removed to allow active ROM of the wrist, while allowing the digits to rest in & relaxed posture (not a fist) . These exercises may be performed 3-4 times & day, 15 repetitions [Patient Handout]<br /><br />Weeks Postop AROM exercises may be initiated to the wrist and digits 4-6 times a day, 25 repetitions The progression of exercises may include: Shortarc to midarc light active flexion; followed by forceful active extension to gradually mobilize the adherent scar and gain tendon gliding: The arc of flexion is gradually increased to full active flexion over the period of a week. So long as full active MPJ extension can be achieved; add isolated EDC exercises with the IP joints remaining flexed while flexing/extending the MP joints. IPJ slings may be used to maintain IPJ flexion while exercising the MP joints. Active MP joint flexion and extension with the PIP/DIP joints extended. Consider orthosis to block IPJ flexion while performing AROM, fabricating an Isolated EIP and EDQM exercises for digital extension Isolated self-passive motion to the wrist<br /><br />Weeks Postop NMES may be initiated as necessary to enhance tendon excursion. It is isolating the EDC with the IP joints taped in flexion or with IPJ slings ontthearacularly effective when digits. Scarretraction is emphasized: There is & high propensity for adherence subcutaneous tissue_ of the Dycem@ may be used to stabilize the skin repairs to the underlying the patient attempts to isolate the MP joints, scar mobilization proximal to the area of adherence' As can be performed to the adhered area: 163<br /><br />
